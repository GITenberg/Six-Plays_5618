<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> been asked to write a few
lines of introduction to these volumes of Country Plays, and I do
so, not because I can claim any right to speak with authority on
the subject of drama, but in order that I may associate myself
and express my sympathy with the endeavour which the author has
made to restore to his rightful estate the English peasant with
whom my work for twenty years or more has brought me into close
relations.</p>
<p>There have been few serious attempts to depict English country
life on the stage.&nbsp; Nor, for that matter, can it be said
that the English peasant has fared over well in our
literature.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the English countryman has
qualities all his own, no less distinctive nor less engaging than
those of his Irish, Scottish, Russian, or Continental neighbours,
even though his especial characteristics have hitherto been for
the most part either ignored or grossly travestied by the
playwright.&nbsp; Now in these plays, as it seems to me, he has
at last come into his own kingdom and is painted, perhaps for the
first time on the stage, in his true colours, neither caricatured
on the one hand, nor, on the other, sentimentalised, but
faithfully portrayed by a peculiarly sympathetic and skilful
hand.</p>
<p>It is well, too, that an authentic record should be preserved
of the life that has been lived in our country villages year in
year out for centuries before its last vestiges&mdash;and they
are all that now remain&mdash;have been completely submerged in
the oncoming tide of modern civilisation and progress.&nbsp;
Moreover, the songs and dances of the English peasantry that have
become widely known in the last few years have awakened a <a
name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>general
interest and curiosity in all that concerns the lives and habits
of country people and there are many who will be glad to know
what manner of men and women were they who created things of so
rare and delicate a beauty.</p>
<p>These plays are very simple plays.&nbsp; With one exception,
&ldquo;The New Year,&rdquo; they rest for their effects upon
dialogue rather than upon dramatic action or plot.&nbsp; There is
nothing harrowing, problematical, or pathological about any of
them.&nbsp; The stories are as simple, obvious and na&iuml;ve,
and have the same happy endings as those which the folk delight
to sing about in their own songs, and from which, indeed, judging
by the titles she has given to her plays, the author drew her
inspiration.</p>
<p>It will be noticed that Lady Darwin has eliminated dialect
from the speech which she has put into the mouths of her
characters.&nbsp; This is not because the English villager has no
vernacular of his own&mdash;there are as many dialects in England
as there are counties&mdash;but because dialect, as no doubt Lady
Darwin knew full well, is not of the essence of speech.&nbsp; It
is the way in which language is used for the purpose of
expression, the order in which words are strung together, the
subtle, elusive turns of speech, the character of its figures and
metaphors, rather than local peculiarities of intonation and
pronunciation, which betray and illumine character.&nbsp; And it
is upon these, the essential characteristics of speech, that the
author of these plays has wisely and, for the most part, wholly,
relied to give life and character to the actors of her
dramas.&nbsp; The results she has achieved by these means is
nothing less than amazing.&nbsp; So accurately has she caught the
peculiar inflections, the inversions, the curious meanderings and
involutions of peasant speech, so penetrating&mdash;uncanny at
times&mdash;is her insight into the structure and working of the
peasant mind, that, did one not know that this was scarcely the
fact, one would have been tempted to suspect that the author had
herself been born and bred <a name="pagevii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vii</span>in a country village and lived all
her days amongst those whose characters and habits of mind she
has described with such fidelity.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, the lesson on courtship which My Man John
gives to his master&mdash;is not the actual phrasing almost
photographic in its accuracy?&nbsp; Note, too, the frequent use
of homely metaphor:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&rsquo;Tis with the maids as &rsquo;tis with the
fowls when they be come out from moult.&nbsp; They be bound to
pick about this way and that in their new feathers.</p>
<p>I warrant she be gone shy as a May bettel when &rsquo;tis
daylight.</p>
<p>Ah, you take and let her go quiet, same as I lets th&rsquo;
old mare when her first comes up from grass.</p>
<p>I likes doing things my own way, mother.&nbsp; Womenfolk, they
be so buzzing.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis like a lot of insects around of
any one on a summer&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; A-saying this way and
that&mdash;whilst a man do go at everything quiet and
calm-like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the following typical sentences:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Well, mother, I count I&rsquo;m back a smartish
bit sooner nor what you did expect.</p>
<p>There was a cow&mdash;well, &rsquo;tis a smartish lot of cows
as I&rsquo;ve seen in my time, but this one, why, the king
haven&rsquo;t got the match to she in all his great palace, and
that&rsquo;s the truth, so &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p>I bain&rsquo;t one as can judge of that, my lord, seeing that
I be got a poor old badger of a man, and the days when I was
young and did carry a heart what could beat with love, be ahind
of I, and the feel of them clean forgot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The task of selection has not been an easy one.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The New Year&rdquo; is the only Country play on large and
ambitious lines which Lady Darwin left behind her, and it is on
this account, as well as for its own merits, which I venture to
think are very considerable, that it has been included.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Princess Royal&rdquo; was <a name="pageviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. viii</span>written for a special occasion, and
is frankly more conventional and artificial than the others, but
it will nevertheless appeal to folk-dancers, and for that reason,
rather than perhaps for its intrinsic value, room has been found
for it.&nbsp; The remaining four are, in their several ways,
typical of the author&rsquo;s work, and I for one have little
doubt but that they will make a wide appeal, more especially
perhaps to those simple-minded people (of whom I am persuaded
there are many, even in these latter-days) who are able to
appreciate the unpretentious beauty of an art that is well-nigh
artless in its simplicity.&nbsp; Some of them may be too slight
in design, too delicate in texture, their beauty too elusive, to
succeed on the professional stage; I do not know.&nbsp; But there
is a large demand for plays of a non-professional character; and
that Lady Darwin&rsquo;s will be acted with pleasure and listened
to with delight in hut or hall or country-house of a
winter&rsquo;s evening, I cannot doubt.</p>

ix</span>FLORENCE HENRIETTA DARWIN</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Florence Henrietta Fisher</span> was born
at 3, Onslow Square, London, in the year 1864; but to those of a
younger generation it seemed that nearly the whole of her youth
had been spent in the New Forest, so largely did it figure in her
stories of the past.&nbsp; It was at Whitley Ridge, Brockenhurst,
that her earliest plays were written, and many marvellous
characters created; their names still live.&nbsp; It was there
that she became a very good violin player, as well as a musician
in a wider sense.&nbsp; It was in Brockenhurst Church that, in
1886, she married Frederic William Maitland, later Downing
professor of the laws of England.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Maitland lived in Cambridge; for the first two
years at Brookside, and afterwards in the West Lodge of Downing
College.</p>
<p>Along with her love of music there had begun, and there
continued a love of animals, and, from Moses, a dog of
Brockenhurst days, there stretched down a long procession of
dogs, cats, monkeys, foxes, moles, merecats, mongeese, bush cats
and marmosets, accompanied by a variety of birds.&nbsp; If such a
thing as a dumb animal has ever existed it certainly was not one
of hers, for, besides what they were able to say for themselves,
they spoke much through her.&nbsp; Not only were they able to
recount all that had happened to them in past home or jungle,
they were perfectly able to give advice in every situation and to
join in every discussion.&nbsp; Neither were their pens less
ready than their tongues, and many were the letters of flamboyant
script and misspelt word that came forth from cage or basket.</p>
<p>Frederic William Maitland possessed a small property at
Brookthorpe, Gloucestershire; and near this property, in a house
in the village of Edge and at the top of the Horsepools hill, he
and his wife and their two children <a name="pagex"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. x</span>spent most of their holidays.&nbsp;
They were happy days.&nbsp; Animals increased in number and
rejoiced in freedom, fairs were attended, dancing bears and bird
carts came at intervals to the door, gipsies were delighted in
and protected, and it was there that many friendships with
country people were made.&nbsp; Several days a week would find
Mrs. Maitland driving down to Brookthorpe in donkey or pony cart
to see tenants, to enquire for or feed the sick, to visit the
school, to advise and be advised in the many difficulties of
human life.&nbsp; With a wonderful memory and power of
reproducing that which she had heard, she brought back rare
harvest from these expeditions.&nbsp; All through her days she
was told more in a week than many people hear in a life-time.</p>
<p>After much illness, Professor Maitland was told that he must
leave England, and in 1898 the Maitlands set sail to the island
of Grand Canary; and it was there that they spent each winter,
with the exception of one in Madeira, until Professor
Maitland&rsquo;s death in 1906.&nbsp; The beauty and warmth of
the island were a joy to Mrs. Maitland, washing out all the
difficulties of housekeeping and the labour of cooking.&nbsp; The
day of hardest work still left her time to set forth, accompanied
by a faithful one-legged hen, to seek the shade of chestnut or
loquat tree, and there to write.&nbsp; The song of frogs rising
from watery palm grove, the hot dusty scent of pepper tree, the
cool scent of orange, the mountains sharp and black against the
evening sky, the brightly coloured houses crowded to the brink of
still brighter sea, were all things she loved, and their images
remained with her always.&nbsp; She became an expert talker of
what she called kitchen Spanish, and her store of country history
increased greatly, for, from Candelaria, the washer-woman to Don
Luis the grocer, she met no one who was not ready to tell her all
the marvels that ever they knew.</p>
<p>In 1906 Frederic William Maitland landed on the island too ill
to reach the house that Mrs. Maitland had gone out earlier to
prepare for him.&nbsp; He was taken to an <a
name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>hotel in the
city of Las Palmas, and there, on December the 19th, he died.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1907 Mrs. Maitland returned to England.</p>
<p>In 1909 she added on to a small farm house at Brookthorpe, and
there she went to live.&nbsp; She was thus able to renew many
friendships, and in some slight degree take up the life that had
been so dear to her.&nbsp; It was during these last eleven years
at Brookthorpe that she wrote all her plays dealing with country
people; the first for a class of village children to whom she
taught singing, the later ones in response to a growing demand
not only from other Gloucestershire villages, but from village
clubs and institutes scattered over a large part of
England.&nbsp; She saw several of her plays acted by the Oakridge
and the Sapperton players, and these performances and letters
from other performers gave her great pleasure.</p>
<p>In 1913 she married Sir Francis Darwin.&nbsp; Their life at
Brookthorpe was varied by months spent at his house in
Cambridge.&nbsp; It was there that she died on March 5th,
1920.</p>
<p>During her last years she had much illness to contend
with.&nbsp; Unable to play her violin, she turned to the
spinet.&nbsp; She practised for hours, wrote plays, and attended
to her house when many would have lain in their beds.</p>
<p>Her religion became of increasingly great comfort and interest
to her, and it was in that light that she came, more and more, to
look at all things.</p>
<p>In the minds of many who knew her in those years rose up the
words: I have fought a good fight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Setting down the

class="smcap">Annet</span> <i>rises and goes to the door followed

polishing leather upon the ground</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Picking it up

was a careless little wench, &rsquo;tis she.&nbsp; I never did
hold with the bringing up of other folks children and if
I&rsquo;d had my way, &rsquo;tis to the poor-house they&rsquo;d
have went, instead of coming here where I&rsquo;ve enough to do
with my own.</p>
<p>[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Farmer</span> <i>comes in
followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Annet</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">May</span> <i>carrying large parcels</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Well Mother, I count
I&rsquo;m back a smartish bit sooner nor what you did expect.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not one
that can be taken by surprise, Dan.&nbsp; May, lay that parcel on
the table at once, and put away your uncle&rsquo;s hat and
overcoat.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dan</span>.&nbsp; Nay, the
overcoat&rsquo;s too heavy for the little maid&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
hang it up myself.</p>
<p>[<i>He takes off his coat and goes out into the passage to
hang it up</i>.&nbsp; <i>May runs after him with his hat</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; I do want to know
what&rsquo;s in all those great packets, Aunt.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; I daresay
you&rsquo;ll be told all in good season.&nbsp; Here, take up and
get on with that sewing, I dislike to see young people idling
away their time.</p>
<p>[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Farmer</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">May</span> <i>come back</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; And now, untie the
packets quickly, uncle.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Sinking into a
big chair</i>.]&nbsp; Not so fast, my little maid, not so
fast&mdash;&rsquo;tis a powerful long distance as I have
journeyed this day, and &rsquo;tis wonderful warm for the time of
year.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t hold
with drinking nor with taking bites atween meals, but as your
uncle has come a good distance, and the day is warm, you make
take the key of the pantry, Annet, and draw a glass of cider for
him.</p>
<p>[<i>She takes the key from her pocket and hands it to</i>
<span class="smcap">Annet</span>, <i>who goes out</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it,
Mother&mdash;that&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; And when I&rsquo;ve wetted my
mouth a bit I&rsquo;ll be able the better to tell you all about
how &rsquo;twas over there.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; O I&rsquo;d dearly like
to go to a Fair, I would.&nbsp; You always said that you&rsquo;d
take me the next time you went, Uncle.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Ah and so I did, but
when I comed to think it over, Fairs baint the place for little
maids, I says to mother here&mdash;and no, that they baint, she
answers back.&nbsp; But we&rsquo;ll see how &rsquo;tis when you
be growed a bit older, like.&nbsp; Us&rsquo;ll see how
&rsquo;twill be then, won&rsquo;t us Mother?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t
encourage the child in her nonsense, if I was you, Dan.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s old enough to know better than to ask to be taken to
such places.&nbsp; Why in all my days I never set my foot within
a fair, pleasure or business, nor wanted to, either.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; And never rode on the
pretty wood horses, Aunt, all spotted and with scarlet bridles to
them?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Certainly
not.&nbsp; I wonder at your asking such a question, May.&nbsp;
But you do say some very unsuitable things for a little child of
your age.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; And did you get astride
of the pretty horses at the Fair, Uncle?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Nay, nay,&mdash;they
horses be set in the pleasure part of the Fair, and where I goes
&rsquo;tis all for doing business like.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Annet</span> <i>comes back with the glass
of cider</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>takes it
from her</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Drinking</i>.]&nbsp; You might as well have brought the jug,
my girl.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; No, Father,
&rsquo;twill spoil your next meal as it is.</p>
<p>[<i>The girls sit down at the table</i>, <i>taking up their
work</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Putting down his
glass</i>.]&nbsp; But, bless my soul, yon was a Fair in a
hundred.&nbsp; That her was.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Both Girls</span>.&nbsp; O do tell us of
all that you did see there, Uncle.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; There was a
cow&mdash;well, &rsquo;tis a smartish lot of cows as I&rsquo;ve
seen in my time, but this one, why, the King haven&rsquo;t got
the match to she in all his great palace, and that&rsquo;s the
truth, so &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; O don &rsquo;t tell us
about the cows, Uncle, we want to know about all the other
things.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; The shows of acting
folk, and the wild animals, and the nice sweets.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t
want to hear about anything sensible, Dan.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re
like all the maids now, with their thoughts set on pleasuring and
foolishness.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Ah, the maids was
different in our day, wasn&rsquo;t they Mother?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; And that they
were.&nbsp; Why, when I was your age, Annet, I should have been
ashamed if I couldn&rsquo;t have held my own in any proper or
suitable conversation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Ah, you was a rare
sensible maid in your day, Mother.&nbsp; Do you mind when you
comed along of me to Kingham sale?&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
never going to buy an animal with all that white to it,&rdquo;
Dan, you says to me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Ah&mdash;I
recollect.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
true her has a whitish leg,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;but so have I,
and so have you, Mother&mdash;and who&rsquo;s to think the worse
on we for that?&rdquo;&nbsp; Ah, I could always bring you round
to look at things quiet and reasonable in those days&mdash;that I
could.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; And a good thing
if there were others of the same pattern now, I&rsquo;m
thinking.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; So &rsquo;twould
be&mdash;so &rsquo;twould be.&nbsp; But times do bring changes in
the forms of the cattle and I count &rsquo;tis the same with the
womenfolk.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis one thing this year and &rsquo;tis
t&rsquo;other in the next.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Do tell us more of what
you did see at the Fair, Uncle.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; There was a
ram.&nbsp; My word! but the four feet of he did cover a good two
yards of ground; just as it might be, standing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Come, Father.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; And the horns upon
the head of he did reach out very nigh as far as might do the
sails of one of they old wind-mills.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; O Uncle, and how was it
with the wool of him?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; The wool, my wench,
did stand a good three foot from all around of the animal.&nbsp;
You might have set a hen with her eggs on top of it&mdash;and
that you might.&nbsp; And now I comes to recollect how
&rsquo;twas, you could have set a hen one side of the wool and a
turkey t&rsquo;other.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; O Uncle, that must have
been a beautiful animal!&nbsp; And what was the tail of it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; The tail, my little
maid?&nbsp; Why &rsquo;twas longer nor my arm and as thick
again&mdash;&rsquo;twould have served as a bell rope to the great
bell yonder in Gloucester church&mdash;and so
&rsquo;twould.&nbsp; Ah, &rsquo;twas sommat like a tail, I
reckon, yon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Come, Father, such
talk is hardly suited to little girls, who should know better
than to ask so many teasing questions.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t
only May, Aunt, I do love to hear what uncle tells, when he has
been out for a day or two.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; And did you have
company on the way home, Father?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; That I did.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twas along of young Andrew as I did come back.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Along of
Andrew?&nbsp; Girls, you may now go outside into the garden for a
while.&nbsp; Yes, put aside your work.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t we stop till
the packets are opened?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; You heard what I
said?&nbsp; Go off into the garden, and stop there till I send
for you.&nbsp; And take uncle&rsquo;s glass and wash it at the
spout as you go.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking the
glass</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll wash it, Aunt.&nbsp; Come May, you
see aunt doesn&rsquo;t want us any longer.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Now they&rsquo;re going
to talk secrets together.&nbsp; O I should dearly love to hear
the secrets of grown-up people.&nbsp; [<span
class="smcap">Annet</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">May</span> <i>go out together</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Annet be got a fine
big wench, upon my word.&nbsp; Now haven&rsquo;t her, Mother?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s got
old enough to be put to service, and if I&rsquo;d have had my
way, &rsquo;tis to service she&rsquo;d have gone this long time
since, and that it is.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould be poor
work putting one of dead sister&rsquo;s wenches out to service,
so long as us have a roof over the heads of we and plenty to eat
on the table.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Well, you must
please yourself about it Father, as you do most times.&nbsp; But
&rsquo;tis uncertain work taking up with other folks children as
I told you from the first.&nbsp; See what a lot of trouble you
and me have had along of Giles.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Giles be safe enough
in them foreign parts where I did send him.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve no
need to trouble your head about he, Mother&mdash;unless
&rsquo;tis a letter as he may have got sending to Mill.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; No, Father, Giles
has never sent a letter since the day he left home.&nbsp; But
very often there is no need for letters to keep remembrance
green.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a plant what thrives best on a soil that
is bare.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Well, Mother, and
what be you a-driving at?&nbsp; I warrant as Mill have got over
them notions as she did have once.&nbsp; And, look you here,
&rsquo;twas with young Andrew as I did journey back from the
Fair.&nbsp; And he be a-coming up presently for to get his
answer.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; All I say is that
I hope he may get it then.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Ah, I reckon as
&rsquo;tis rare put about as he have been all this long while,
and never a downright &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to what he do ask.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">May</span> <i>comes softly in and hides
behind the door</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s
not my fault, Father.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; But her&rsquo;ll have
to change her note this day, that her&rsquo;ll have.&nbsp; For
I&rsquo;ve spoke for she, and &rsquo;tis for next month as
I&rsquo;ve pitched the wedding day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; And you may pitch,
Father.&nbsp; You may lead the mare down to the pond, but
she&rsquo;ll not drink if she hasn&rsquo;t the mind to.&nbsp; You
know what Millie is.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t from my side that
she gets it either.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; And
&rsquo;tain&rsquo;t from me.&nbsp; I be all for easy going and
each one to his self like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Yes, there you
are, Father.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; But I reckon as the
little maid will hearken to what I says.&nbsp; Her was always a
wonderful good little maid to her dad.&nbsp; And her did always
know, that when her dad did set his foot down, well, there
&rsquo;twas.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas down.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Well, if you think
you can shew her that, Father, &rsquo;tis a fortunate job on all
sides.</p>
<p>[<i>They suddenly see</i> <span class="smcap">May</span>
<i>who has been quiet behind the door</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; May, what are you
a-doing here I should like to know?&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t I send you
out into the garden along of your sister?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Yes, Auntie, but
I&rsquo;ve comed back.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Then you can be
off again, and shut the door this time, do your hear?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it, my
little maid.&nbsp; Run along&mdash;and look you, May, just you
tell Cousin Millie as we wants her in here straight away.&nbsp;
And who knows bye and bye whether there won&rsquo;t be sommat in
yon great parcel for a good little wench.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; O Uncle&mdash;I&rsquo;d
like to see it now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Nay, nay&mdash;this
is not a suitable time&mdash;Aunt and me has business
what&rsquo;s got to be settled like.&nbsp; Nay&mdash;&rsquo;tis
later on as the packets is to be opened.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Get along off, you
tiresome child.&mdash;One word might do for some, but it takes
twenty to get you to move.&mdash;Run along now, do you hear
me?</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">May</span> <i>goes</i>.</p>
<p>Well, Father, I&rsquo;ve done my share with Millie and she
don&rsquo;t take a bit of notice of what I say.&nbsp; So now
it&rsquo;s your turn.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Ah, I count
&rsquo;tis more man&rsquo;s work, this here, so &rsquo;tis.&nbsp;
There be things which belongs to females and there be others
which do not.&nbsp; You get and leave it all to me.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll bring it off.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; All right, Father,
just you try your way&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have nothing more to do
with it.&nbsp; [<span class="smcap">Millie</span> <i>comes
in</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; Why, Father,
you&rsquo;re back early from the Fair.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s so, my
wench.&nbsp; See that package over yonder?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; O, that I do,
Father.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Yon great one&rsquo;s
for you, Mill.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; O Father,
what&rsquo;s inside it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a new,
smart bonnet, my wench.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; For me, Father?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Ah&mdash;who else
should it be for, Mill?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; O Father, you are
good to me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; And a silk cloak as
well.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; A silken cloak, and a
bonnet&mdash;O Father, &rsquo;tis too much for you to give me all
at once, like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Young Andrew did help
me with the choice, and &rsquo;tis all to be worn on this day
month, my girl.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; Why, Father,
what&rsquo;s to happen then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis for you to
go along to church in, Mill.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; To church,
Father?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Ah, that
&rsquo;tis&mdash;you in the cloak and bonnet, and upon the arm of
young Andrew, my wench.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; O no, Father.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis
&ldquo;yes&rdquo; as you have got to learn, my wench.&nbsp; And
quickly too.&nbsp; For &rsquo;tis this very evening as Andrew be
coming for his answer.&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis to be
&ldquo;yes&rdquo; this time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; O no, Father.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve an hour
before you, my wench, in which to get another word to your
tongue.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t learn
any word that isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;no,&rdquo; Father.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Look at me, my
wench.&nbsp; My foot be down.&nbsp; I means what I
says&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; And I mean what I
say, too, Father.&nbsp; And I say, No!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Millie, I&rsquo;ve
set down my foot.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; And so have I,
Father.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis
&ldquo;yes&rdquo; as you must say to young Andrew when he do come
a-courting of you this night.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; That I&rsquo;ll never
say, Father.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want cloaks nor bonnets, nor my
heart moved by gifts, or tears brought to my eyes by fair
words.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not wed unless I can give my love along
with my hand.&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis not to Andrew I can give that,
as you know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; And to whom should a
maid give her heart if &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t to Andrew?&nbsp; A
finer lad never trod in a pair of shoes.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be
blest if I do know what the wenches be a-coming to.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; There, Father, I
told you what to expect.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis master
as I&rsquo;ll be, hark you, Mother, hark you, Mill.&nbsp; And
&rsquo;tis &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; as you have got to fit your tongue
out with my girl, afore &rsquo;tis dark.&nbsp;
[<i>Rising</i>.]&nbsp; I be a&rsquo;going off to the yard, but,
Mother, her&rsquo;ll know what to say to you, her will.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; Dad, do you stop and
shew me the inside of my packet.&nbsp; Let us put Andrew aside
and be happy&mdash;do!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Ah, I&rsquo;ve got
other things as is waiting to be done nor breaking in a tricksome
filly to run atween the shafts.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis fitter work for
females, and so &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; And so I told you,
Father, from the start.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis
&ldquo;No&rdquo; that I shall say.</p>

<h3>ACT I.&mdash;Scene 2.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>It is dusk on the same
evening</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span> <i>is standing by the table
folding up the silken cloak</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Annet</span> <i>sits watching her</i>, <i>on her
knees lies a open parcel disclosing a woollen shawl</i>.&nbsp;
<i>In a far corner of the room</i> <span class="smcap">May</span>
<i>is seated on a stool making a daisy chain</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas very good
of Uncle to bring me this nice shawl, Millie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; You should have had a
cloak like mine, Annet, by rights.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not going to
get married, Millie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Sitting down with
a sudden movement of despondence and stretching her arms across
the table</i>.]&nbsp; O don&rsquo;t you speak to me of that,
Annet.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis more than I can bear to-night.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; But, Millie,
he&rsquo;s coming for your answer now.&nbsp; You musn&rsquo;t let
him find you looking so.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; My face shall look as
my heart feels.&nbsp; And that is all sorrow, Annet.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you bring
yourself round to fancy Andrew, Millie?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; No, that I cannot,
Annet, I&rsquo;ve tried a score of times, I have&mdash;but there
it is&mdash;I cannot.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; Is it that
you&rsquo;ve not forgotten Giles, then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; I never shall forget
him, Annet.&nbsp; Why, &rsquo;tis a five year this day since
father sent him off to foreign parts, and never a moment of all
that time has my heart not remembered him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; I feared &rsquo;twas
so with you, Millie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; O I&rsquo;ve laid
awake of nights and my tears have wetted the pillow all over so
that I&rsquo;ve had to turn it t&rsquo;other side up.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; And Giles has never
written to you, nor sent a sign nor nothing?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; Your brother Giles
was never very grand with the pen, Annet.&nbsp; But, O,
he&rsquo;s none the worse for that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; Millie, I never cared
for to question you, but how was it when you and he did part, one
with t&rsquo;other?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; I did give him my
ring, Annet&mdash;secret like&mdash;when we were walking in the
wood.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; What, the one with the
white stones to it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; Yes,
grandmother&rsquo;s ring, that she left me.&nbsp; And I did say
to him&mdash;if ever I do turn false to you and am like to wed
another, Giles&mdash;look you at these white stones.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; Seven of them, there
were, Millie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; And the day that I am
like to wed another, Giles, I said to him, the stones shall
darken.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;ll never see that day.&nbsp; [<i>She
begins to cry</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you give
way, Millie, for, look you, &rsquo;tis very likely that Giles has
forgotten you for all his fine words, and Andrew,&mdash;well,
Andrew he&rsquo;s as grand a suitor as ever maid had.&nbsp; And
&rsquo;tis Andrew you have got to wed, you know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; Andrew,
Andrew&mdash;I&rsquo;m sick at the very name of him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; See the fine house
you&rsquo;ll live in.&nbsp; Think on the grand parlour that
you&rsquo;ll sit in all the day with a servant to wait on you and
naught but Sunday clothes on your back.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d sooner go
in rags with Giles at the side of me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; Come, you must hearten
up.&nbsp; Andrew will soon be here.&nbsp; And Uncle says that you
have got to give him his answer to-night for good and all.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; O I cannot see
him&mdash;I&rsquo;m wearied to death of Andrew, and that&rsquo;s
the very truth it is.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; O Millie&mdash;I
wonder how &rsquo;twould feel to be you for half-an-hour and to
have such a fine suitor coming to me and asking for me to say
Yes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; O I wish &rsquo;twas
you and not me that he was after, Annet.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t
likely that anyone such as Master Andrew will ever come courting
a poor girl like me, Millie.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;d dearly love to
know how &rsquo;twould feel.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Millie</span> <i>raises her head and
looks at her cousin for a few minutes in silence</i>, <i>then her
face brightens</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; Then you shall,
Annet.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; Shall what, Mill?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; Know how it
feels.&nbsp; Look here&mdash;&rsquo;Tis sick to death I am with
courting, when &rsquo;tis from the wrong quarter, and if
I&rsquo;m to wed Andrew come next month, I&rsquo;ll not be
tormented with him before that time,&mdash;so &rsquo;tis you that
shall stop and talk with him this evening, Annet, and I&rsquo;ll
slip out to the woods and gather flowers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; How wild and unlikely
you do talk, Mill.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; In the dusk
he&rsquo;ll never know that &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t me.&nbsp; Being
cousins, we speak after the same fashion, and in the shape of us
there&rsquo;s not much that&rsquo;s amiss.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; But in the clothing of
us, Mill&mdash;why, &rsquo;tis a grand young lady that you
look&mdash;whilst I&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking up the
silken cloak</i>.]&nbsp; Here&mdash;put this over your gown,
Annet.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Standing
up</i>.]&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mind just trying it on, like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Fastening
it</i>.]&nbsp; There&mdash;and now the bonnet, with the veil
pulled over the face.</p>
<p>[<i>She ties the bonnet and arranges the veil on</i> <span
class="smcap">Annet</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Standing back and
surveying her cousin</i>.]&nbsp; There, Annet, there May, who is
to tell which of us &rsquo;tis?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Coming
forward</i>.]&nbsp; O I should never know that
&rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t you, Cousin Mill.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; And I could well
mistake her for myself too, so listen, Annet.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
you that shall talk with Master Andrew when he comes
to-night.&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis you that shall give him my
answer.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not burn my lips by speaking the word he
asks of me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; O Mill&mdash;I
cannot&mdash;no I cannot.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let him
have it very easily, Annet.&nbsp; Set him a ditch or two to jump
before he gets there.&nbsp; And let the thorns prick him a bit
before he gathers the flower.&nbsp; You know my way with him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; And I know it too,
Millie&mdash;Why, your tongue, &rsquo;tis very near as sharp as
when Aunt do speak.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; O Millie, take off
these things&mdash;I cannot do it, that&rsquo;s the truth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking out through
the door</i>.]&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Andrew a-coming over the mill
yard.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; Here, sit down,
Annet, with the back of you to the light.</p>
<p>[<i>She pushes</i> <span class="smcap">Annet</span> <i>into a
chair beneath the window</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Can I get into the
cupboard and listen to it, Cousin Mill?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; If you promise to
bide quiet and to say naught of it afterwards.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; O I promise, I
promise&mdash;I&rsquo;ll just leave a crack of the door open for
to hear well.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">May</span> <i>gets into the
cupboard</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Millie</span> <i>takes
up</i> <span class="smcap">Annet&rsquo;s</span> <i>new shawl and
puts it all over her</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; No one will think
that &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t you, in the dusk.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; O Millie, what is it
that you&rsquo;ve got me to do?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; Never you mind,
Annet&mdash;you shall see what &rsquo;tis to have a grand suitor
and I shall get a little while of quiet out yonder, where I can
think on Giles.</p>
<p>[<i>She runs out of the door just as</i> <span
class="smcap">Andrew</span> <i>comes up</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Andrew</span> <i>knocks and then enters the open

off to in such a hurry?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Very
faintly</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp;
[<span class="smcap">Andrew</span> <i>lays aside his hat and
comes up to the window</i>.&nbsp; <i>He stands before</i> <span
class="smcap">Annet</span> <i>looking down on her</i>.&nbsp;
<i>She becomes restless under his gaze</i>, <i>and at last signs
to him to sit down</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Sitting down on a
chair a little way from her</i>.]&nbsp; The Master said that I
might come along to-night, Millie&mdash;Otherwise&mdash;[<span
class="smcap">Annet</span> <i>is still silent</i>.</p>
<p>Otherwise I shouldn&rsquo;t have dared do so.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Annet</span> <i>sits nervously twisting
the ribbons of her cloak</i>.</p>
<p>The Master said, as how may be, your feeling for me, Millie,
might be changed like.&nbsp; [<span class="smcap">Annet</span>
<i>is still silent</i>.</p>
<p>And that if I was to ask you once more, very likely
&rsquo;twould be something different as you might say.</p>
<p>[<i>A long silence</i>.</p>
<p>Was I wrong in coming, Millie?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Faintly</i>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould have been better had you
stayed away like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; Then there
isn&rsquo;t any change in your feelings towards me, Millie?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; O, there&rsquo;s a
sort of a change, Andrew.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Slowly</i>.]&nbsp; O Mill, that&rsquo;s good hearing.&nbsp;
What sort of a change is it then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis very hard
to say, Andrew.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; Look you, Mill,
&rsquo;tis more than a five year that I&rsquo;ve been a-courting
of you faithful.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Sighing</i>.]&nbsp; Indeed it is, Andrew.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ve never
got naught but blows for my pains.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Beginning to speak
in a gentle voice and ending sharply</i>.]&nbsp; O I&rsquo;m so
sorry&mdash;No&mdash;I mean&mdash;&rsquo;Tis your own fault,
Andrew.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; But I would sooner
take blows from you than sweet words from another, Millie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; I could never find it
in my heart to&mdash;I mean, &rsquo;tis as well that you should
get used to blows, seeing we&rsquo;re to be wed, Andrew.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; Then &rsquo;tis to
be!&nbsp; O Millie, this is brave news&mdash;Why, I do scarcely
know whether I be awake or dreaming.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Very
sadly</i>.]&nbsp; Very likely you&rsquo;ll be glad enough to be
dreaming a month from now, poor Andrew.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Drawing
nearer</i>.]&nbsp; I am brave, Millie, now that you speak to me
so kind and gentle, and I&rsquo;ll ask you to name the day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Shrinking
back</i>.]&nbsp; O &rsquo;twill be a very long distance from now,
Andrew.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; Millie, it seems to
be your pleasure to take up my heart and play with it same as a
cat does with the mouse.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Becoming gay and
hard in her manner</i>.]&nbsp; Your heart, Andrew?&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twill go all the better afterwards if &rsquo;tis tossed
about a bit first.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; Put an end to this
foolishness, Mill, and say when you&rsquo;ll wed me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Warding him off
with her hand</i>.]&nbsp; You shall have my answer in a new song
Andrew, which I have been learning.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Andrew</span> <i>sits down despondently
and prepares to listen</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; Now hark you to this,
Andrew, and turn it well over in your mind.&nbsp; [<i>She begins
to sing</i>:</p>
<p class="poetry">Say can you plough me an acre of land<br />
Sing Ivy leaf, Sweet William and Thyme.<br />
Between the sea and the salt sea strand<br />
And you shall be a true lover of mine?</p>
<p>[<i>A slight pause</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Annet</span>

<i>who turns away with a heavy sigh</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Singing</i>.]</p>
<p class="poetry">Yes, if you plough it with one ram&rsquo;s
horn<br />
Sing Ivy Leaf, Sweet William and Thyme<br />
And sow it all over with one peppercorn<br />
And you shall be a true lover of mine.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis all
foolishness.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Singing</i>.]</p>
<p class="poetry">Say can you reap with a sickle of leather<br />
Sing Ivy Leaf, Sweet William and Thyme<br />
And tie it all up with a Tom-tit&rsquo;s feather<br />
And you shall be a true lover of mine.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Rises up
impatiently</i>.]&nbsp; I can stand no more.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve
danced upon my heart till &rsquo;tis fairly brittle, and ready to
be broke by a feather.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Very
gently</i>.]&nbsp; O Andrew, I&rsquo;ll mend your heart one
day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; Millie, the sound of
those words has mended it already.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; [<i>In a harder
voice</i>.]&nbsp; But very likely there&rsquo;ll be a crack left
to it always.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Farmer Daniel</span> <i>and</i> <span

boy, I knowed as you&rsquo;d bring the little maid to the senses
of she.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Millie has not
shown any backwardness in clothing herself as though for
church.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis with the
maids as &rsquo;tis with the fowls when they be come out from
moult.&nbsp; They be bound to pick about this way and that in
their new feathers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Well, &rsquo;tis
to be hoped the young people have fixed it up for good and all
this time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Come Mill, my wench,
you be wonderful quiet.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s your tongue?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; I think
we&rsquo;ve all had quite enough of Millie&rsquo;s tongue,
Father.&nbsp; Let her give it a rest if she&rsquo;ve a mind.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; I warrant she be gone
as shy as a May bettel when &rsquo;tis daylight.&nbsp; But
us&rsquo;ll take it as she have fixed it up in her own mind
like.&nbsp; Come, Mother, such a time as this, you won&rsquo;t
take no objection to the drawing of a jug of cider.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; And supper just
about to be served?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m surprised at you,
Father.&nbsp; No, I can&rsquo;t hear of cider being drawn so
needless like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Well,
well,&mdash;have it your own way&mdash;but I always says, and my
father used to say it afore I, a fine deed do call for a fine
drink, and that&rsquo;s how &rsquo;twas in my time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Millie, do you
call your cousins in to supper.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Ah, and where be the
maids gone off to this time of night, Mother?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; Annet did pass me as
I came through the yard, Master</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">May</span>, <i>quietly opens the cupboard
door and comes out</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; So that&rsquo;s
where you&rsquo;ve been, you deceitful little wench.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; Well, to think of
that, Millie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; And how long may
you have bid there, I should like to know?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Come, come, my little
maid, &rsquo;tis early days for you to be getting a lesson in
courtship.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; O there wasn&rsquo;t any
courtship, Uncle, and I didn&rsquo;t hear nothing at all to speak
of.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; There, run along
quick and find your sister.&nbsp; Supper&rsquo;s late already,
and that it is.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go with
her.</p>
<p>[<i>She starts forward and hurriedly moves towards the
door</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Stop a moment,
Millie.&nbsp; What are you thinking of to go trailing out in the
dew with that beautiful cloak and bonnet.&nbsp; Take and lay them
in the box at once, do you hear?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it,
Mill.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t do for to mess them up afore
the day.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas a fair price as I gived for they, and
that I can tell you, my girl.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Annet</span> <i>stops
irresolutely</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">May</span> <i>seizes
her hand</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Come off, come off,
&ldquo;Cousin Millie&rdquo;; &rsquo;tis not damp outside, and O
I&rsquo;m afeared to cross the rickyard by myself.</p>
<p>[<i>She pulls</i> <span class="smcap">Annet</span>
<i>violently by the hand and draws her out of the door</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Off with the cloak
this minute, Millie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Calling
back</i>.]&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a-taking of it off, Aunt, she
is.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
what&rsquo;s come to the maid.&nbsp; She don&rsquo;t act like
herself to-day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Ah, that be asking
too much of a maid, to act like herself, and the wedding day
close ahead of she.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d be
content with a suitable behaviour, Father.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not
hard to please.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Ah, you take and let
her go quiet, same as I lets th&rsquo; old mare when her first
comes up from grass.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis all
very well for you to talk, Father but &rsquo;tis I who have got
to do.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Come Mother, come
Andrew, I be sharp set.&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis the feel of victuals
and no words as I wants in my mouth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Well, Father,
I&rsquo;m not detaining you.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s the door, and
the food has been cooling on the table this great while.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Come you, Andrew,
come you, Mother.&nbsp; Us&rsquo;ll make a bit of a marriage
feast this night.</p>

<h3>ACT II.&mdash;Scene 1.</h3>
<p><i>A woodland path</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Giles</span>
<i>comes forward with his two servants</i>, <span
class="smcap">George</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">John</span>, <i>who are carrying heavy
packets</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis powerful
warm to-day.&nbsp; We will take a bit of rest before we go
further.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Setting down his
packet</i>.]&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it, master.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a
rare weight as I&rsquo;ve been carrying across my back since
dawn.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Also setting down
his burden</i>.]&nbsp; Ah, I be pleased for to lay aside
yon.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis wonderful heavy work, this journeying to
and fro with gold and silver.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; Our travelling is very
nigh finished.&nbsp; There lies the road which goes to Camel
Farm.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Oh, I count as that
must be a rare sort of a place, master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Seeing as us
haven&rsquo;t stopped scarce an hour since us landed off the
sea.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; But have come running
all the while same as the fox may run in th&rsquo; early morning
towards the poultry yard.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Nor broke bread, nor
scarce got a drop of drink to wet th&rsquo; insides of we.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis very little
further that you have got to journey, my good lads.&nbsp; We are
nigh to the end of our wayfaring.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; And what sort of a
place be we a-coming to, master?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the place
out of all the world to me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; I count &rsquo;tis
sommat rare and fine in that case, seeing as we be come from
brave foreign parts, master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis rarer, and
finer than all the foreign lands that lie beneath the sun, my
lads.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s good
hearing, master.&nbsp; And is the victuals like to be as fine as
the place?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; O, you&rsquo;ll fare
well enough yonder.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; I was never one for
foreign victuals, nor for the drink that was over there
neither.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; Well, the both of you
shall rest this night beneath the grandest roof that ever
sheltered a man&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; And you shall sit at a table
spread as you&rsquo;ve not seen this many a year.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;ll be
sommat to think on, master, when us gets upon our legs again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; I be thinking of it
ahead as I lies here, and that&rsquo;s the truth.</p>
<p>[<i>The two servants stretch themselves comfortably beneath
the trees</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap"><i>Giles</i></span><i>
walks restlessly backwards and forwards as though impatient at
any delay</i>.&nbsp; <i>From time to time he glances at a ring

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a
wonderful warm sun to-day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re right
there, master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span>.&nbsp; I warrant as you be
journeying towards the same place where I be going, my lord.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; And where is that, old
master?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span>.&nbsp; Towards Camel
Farm.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
right.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis there and nowhere else that we are
going.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span>.&nbsp; Ah, us&rsquo;ll have
to go smartish if us is to be there in time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; In time for what, my
good man?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span>.&nbsp; In time for to see
the marrying, my lord.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; The marrying?&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re telling me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis at noon
this day that she&rsquo;s to be wed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; Who are you speaking
of, old man?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span>.&nbsp; And where is your
lordship journeying this day if &rsquo;tis not to the
marrying?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s getting
wed up yonder, tell me quickly?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis th&rsquo;
old farmer&rsquo;s daughter what&rsquo;s to wed come
noon-tide.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Starting</i>.]&nbsp; Millie!&nbsp; O that is heavy
news.&nbsp; [<i>Looking at his hand</i>.]&nbsp; Then &rsquo;tis
as I feared, for since daybreak yesterday the brightness has all
gone from out of the seven stones.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how
&rsquo;twould be, she told me once.</p>
<p>[<i>He turns away from the others in deep distress of
mind</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Us&rsquo;ll see no
Camel Farm this day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Ah, he&rsquo;d best
have stopped where he was.&nbsp; Camel Farm baint no place for
the like of he to go courting at.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Ah, master be used to
them great palaces, all over gold and marble with windows as you
might drive a waggon through, and that you might.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; All painted
glass.&nbsp; And each chair with golden legs to him, and a sight
of silver vessels on the table as never you did dream of after a
night&rsquo;s drinking, old man.&nbsp; [<span

<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; And who is she to wed,

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span>.&nbsp; Be you a-speaking of
the young mistress up at Camel Farm, my lord?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; With whom
does she go to church to-day?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis along of
Master Andrew that her do go.&nbsp; What lives up Cranham
way.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; Ah, th&rsquo; old
farmer was always wonderful set on him.&nbsp; [<i>A
pause</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span>.&nbsp; I be a poor old
wretch what journeys upon the roads, master, and maybe I picks a
crust here and gets a drink of water there, and the shelter of
the pig-stye wall to rest the bones of me at night time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; What matters it if you
be old and poor, master, so that the heart of you be whole and
unbroken?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span>.&nbsp; Us poor old wretches
don&rsquo;t carry no hearts to th&rsquo; insides of we.&nbsp; The
pains of us do come from the having of no victuals and from the
winter&rsquo;s cold when snow do lie on the ground and the wind
do moan over the fields, and when the fox do bark.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; What is the pang of
hunger and the cold bite of winter set against the cruel torment
of a disappointed love?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span>.&nbsp; I baint one as can
judge of that, my lord, seeing that I be got a poor old badger of
a man, and the days when I was young and did carry a heart what
could beat with love, be ahind of I, and the feel of them clean
forgot.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; Then what do you up
yonder at the marrying this morning?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span>.&nbsp; Oh, I do take me to
those places where there be burying or marriage, for the hearts
of folk at these seasons be warmed and kinder, like.&nbsp; And
&rsquo;tis bread and meat as I gets then.&nbsp; Food be thrown
out to the poor old dog what waits patient at the door.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looks intently at
him for a moment</i>.]&nbsp; See here, old master.&nbsp; I would
fain strike a bargain with you.&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis with a
handful of golden pieces that I will pay your service.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span>.&nbsp; Anything to oblige
you, my young lord.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">George</span>.]&nbsp; Take out a handful from the
bag of gold.&nbsp; And you, John, give him some of the
silver.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">George</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">John</span> <i>untie their bags and take out gold
and silver</i>.&nbsp; <i>They twist it up in a handkerchief which
they give to the old man</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span>.&nbsp; May all the
blessings of heaven rest on you, my lord, for &rsquo;tis plain to
see that you be one of the greatest and finest gentlemen ever
born to the land.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; My good friend,
you&rsquo;re wrong there, I was a poor country lad, but I had the
greatest treasure that a man could hold on this earth.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twas the love of my cousin Millie.&nbsp; And being poor, I
was put from out the home, and sent to seek my fortune in parts
beyond the sea.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span>.&nbsp; Now, who&rsquo;d
have thought &rsquo;twas so, for the looks of you be gentle born
all over.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come back with
a bushel of gold in one hand and one of silver in
t&rsquo;other&rdquo; the old farmer said to me, &ldquo;and then
maybe I&rsquo;ll let you wed my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span>.&nbsp; And here you be
comed back, and there lie the gold and the silver bags.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; And yonder is Millie
given in marriage to another.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Taint done
yet, master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t too
late, by a long way, master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Old Man</span>.]&nbsp; And so I would crave
something of you, old friend.&nbsp; Lend me your smock, and your
big hat and your staff.&nbsp; In that disguise I will go to the
farm and look upon my poor false love once more.&nbsp; If I find
that her heart is already given to another, I shall not make
myself known to her.&nbsp; But if she still holds to her love for
me, then&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Go in the fine
clothes what you have upon you, master.&nbsp; And even should the
maid&rsquo;s heart, be given to another, the sight of so grand a
cloth and such laces will soon turn it the right way again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Ah, that&rsquo;s so, it
is.&nbsp; You go as you be clothed now, master.&nbsp; I know what
maids be, and &rsquo;tis finery and good coats which do work more
on the hearts of they nor anything else in the wide world.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; No, no, my lads.&nbsp;
I will return as I did go from yonder.&nbsp; Poor, and in mean
clothing.&nbsp; Nor shall a glint of all my wealth speak one word

everything, my sorrowful garments will not hide my love away from
her.</p>

hat</i>.]&nbsp; Here you are master.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Giles</span> <i>hands his own hat to</i>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span>.&nbsp; Pull the hat well
down about the face of you, master, so as the smooth skin of you
be hid.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Turning round in
his disguise</i>.]&nbsp; How&rsquo;s that, my friends?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; You be a sight too
straight in the back, master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Stooping</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll soon better that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Be you a-going in them
fine buckled shoes, master?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; I had forgot the
shoes.&nbsp; When I get near to the house &rsquo;tis barefoot
that I will go.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Then let us be off,
master, for the&rsquo; time be running short.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Ah, that
&rsquo;tis.&nbsp; I count it be close on noon-day now by the look
of the sun.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span>.&nbsp; And heaven be with
you, my young gentleman.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; My good friends, you
shall go with me a little further.&nbsp; And when we have come
close upon the farm, you shall stop in the shelter of a wood that
I know of and await the signal I shall give you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; And what&rsquo;ll
that be, master?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; I shall blow three
times, and loudly from my whistle, here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; And be we to come up to
the farm when we hears you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; As quickly as you can
run.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill be the sign that I need all of you with
me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it, master.&nbsp;
Us do understand what &rsquo;tis as we have got to do.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Old Mar</span>.&nbsp; Ah, &rsquo;tis best
to be finished with hearts that beat to the tune of a
maid&rsquo;s tongue, and to creep quiet along the roads with
naught but them pains as hunger and thirst do bring to th&rsquo;
inside.&nbsp; So &rsquo;tis.</p>

<p><i>The parlour at Camel Farm</i>.&nbsp; <span

moving about the room putting chairs in their places and
arranging ornaments on the dresser</i>, <i>etc.</i>&nbsp; <span

of flowers in her hands</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; And what do you
want to run about in the garden for when I&rsquo;ve just smoothed
your hair and got you all ready to go to church?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve only been
helping Annet gather some flowers to put upon the table.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; You should know
better then.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t I tell you to sit still in that
chair with your hands folded nicely till we were ready to
start.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Why, I couldn&rsquo;t be
sitting there all the while, now could I, Aunt?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; This&rsquo;ll be
the last time as I tie your ribbon, mind.</p>
<p>[<i>She smoothes</i> <span class="smcap">May&rsquo;s</span>
<i>hair and ties it up for her</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Annet</span> <i>comes into the room with more
flowers</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s your
cousin doing now, Annet?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; The door of her room
is still locked, Aunt.&nbsp; And what she says is that she do
want to bide alone there.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; In all my days I
never did hear tell of such a thing, I don&rsquo;t know
what&rsquo;s coming to the world, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; I count that Millie do
like to be all to herself whilst she is a-dressing up grand in
her white gown, and the silken cloak and bonnet.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; Millie&rsquo;s not
a-dressing of herself up.&nbsp; I heard her crying pitiful as I
was gathering flowers in the garden.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Crying?&nbsp;
She&rsquo;ll have something to cry about if she doesn&rsquo;t
look out, when her father comes in, and hears how she&rsquo;s
a-going on.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; I wonder why Cousin
Millie&rsquo;s taking on like this.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t, if
&rsquo;twas me getting married.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Look you, May, you
get and run up, and knock at the door and tell her that
&rsquo;twill soon be time for us to set off to church and that
she have got to make haste in her dressing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll run, Aunt,
only &rsquo;tis very likely as she&rsquo;ll not listen to
anything that I say.&nbsp; [<span class="smcap">May</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Now Annet, no
idling here, if you please.&nbsp; Set the nosegay in water, and
when you&rsquo;ve given a look round to see that everything is in
its place, upstairs with you, and on with your bonnet, do you
hear?&nbsp; Uncle won&rsquo;t wish to be kept waiting for you,
remember.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m all ready
dressed, except for my bonnet, Aunt.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis Millie
that&rsquo;s like to keep Uncle waiting this morning.&nbsp;
[<i>She goes out</i>.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>comes in</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Well,
Mother&mdash;well, girls&mdash;but, bless my soul, where&rsquo;s
Millie got to?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Millie has not
seen fit to shew herself this morning, Father.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
biding up in her room with the door locked, and nothing that
I&rsquo;ve been able to say has been attended to, so perhaps
you&rsquo;ll kindly have your try.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Bless my
soul&mdash;where&rsquo;s May?&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s Annet?&nbsp;
Send one of the little maids up to her, and tell her &rsquo;tis
very nigh time for us to be off.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m fairly
tired of sending up to her, Father.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d best go
yourself.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">May</span> <i>comes into the
room</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Please Aunt, the door,
&rsquo;tis still locked, and Millie is crying ever so sadly
within, and she won&rsquo;t open to me, nor speak, nor
nothing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; There,
Father,&mdash;perhaps you&rsquo;ll believe what I tell you
another time.&nbsp; Millie has got that hardened and wayward,
there&rsquo;s no managing of her, there&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Ah,
&rsquo;twon&rsquo;t be very long as us&rsquo;ll have the managing
of she.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill be young Andrew as&rsquo;ll take she
in hand after this day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis all
very well to talk of young Andrew, but who&rsquo;s a-going to get
her to church with him I&rsquo;d like to know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Why, &rsquo;tis me
as&rsquo;ll do it, to be sure.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Very well, Father,
and we shall all be much obliged to you.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>goes to the door and

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Well, Millie, my
wench.&nbsp; Come you down here.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis time we did set
out.&nbsp; Do you hear me, Mill.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis time we was
off.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> <i>waits

<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you hear

[<i>There is no answer</i>.</p>

Andrew a-waiting for to take you to church.&nbsp; Come you down
this minute.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d best
take sommat and go and break open the door, Father.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis the sensiblest thing as you can do, only you&rsquo;d
never think of anything like that by yourself.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; I likes doing things
my own way, Mother.&nbsp; Women-folk, they be so buzzing.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis like a lot of insects around of anyone on a
summer&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; A-saying this way and that&mdash;whilst
a man do go at anything quiet and calm-like.&nbsp; [<span
class="smcap">Annet</span> <i>comes in</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; Please, Uncle, Millie
says that she isn&rsquo;t coming down for no one.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Roaring in
fury</i>.]&nbsp; What!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that, my
wench&mdash;isn&rsquo;t a-coming down for no one?&nbsp; Hear
that, Mother, hear that?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have sommat to say to
that, I will.&nbsp; [<i>Going to the door</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Roaring up the
stairs</i>.]&nbsp; Hark you, Mill, down you comes this moment
else I&rsquo;ll smash the door right in, and that I will.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>comes back into the
room</i>, <i>storming violently</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Ah, &rsquo;tis a
badly bred up wench is Millie, and her&rsquo;d have growed up
very different if I&rsquo;d a-had the bringing up of she.&nbsp;
But spoiled she is and spoiled her&rsquo;ve always been, and what
could anyone look for from a filly what&rsquo;s been broke in by
women folk!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; There, there,
Father&mdash;there&rsquo;s no need to bluster in this
fashion.&nbsp; Take up the poker and go and break into the door
quiet and decent, like anyone else would do.&nbsp; And
girls&mdash;off for your bonnets this moment I tell you.</p>
<p>[<i>She takes up a poker and hands it to</i> <span

out and upstairs</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Annet</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Good-morning,
Andrew.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s going on
upstairs?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis Father
at a little bit of carpentering.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m come too
soon, I reckon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; We know what young
men be upon their wedding morn!&nbsp; I warrant as the clock
can&rsquo;t run too fast for them at such a time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re right
there, mistress.&nbsp; But the clock have moved powerful slow all
these last few weeks&mdash;for look you here, &rsquo;tis a month
this day since I last set eyes on Mill or had a word from her
lips&mdash;so &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have
enough words presently.&nbsp; Hark, she&rsquo;s coming down with
Father now.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Andrew</span> <i>turns eagerly towards
the door</i>.&nbsp; <i>The farmer enters with</i> <span
class="smcap">Millie</span> <i>clinging to his arm</i>, <i>she
wears her ordinary dress</i>.&nbsp; <i>Her hair is ruffled and in
disorder</i>, <i>and she has been crying</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Andrew, my lad, good
morning to you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; Good morning,
master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t
mind a bit of an April shower, my boy.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the way
with all maids on their wedding morn.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t that so,
Mother?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t
make such a show of myself if I was you, Mill.&nbsp; Go upstairs
this minute and wash your face and smooth your hair and put
yourself ready for church.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Nay, she be but just
come from upstairs, Mother.&nbsp; Let her bide quiet a while with
young Andrew here; whilst do you come along with me and get me
out my Sunday coat.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis time I was dressed for
church too, I&rsquo;m thinking.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
what&rsquo;s come to the house this morning, and that&rsquo;s the
truth.&nbsp; Andrew, I&rsquo;ll not have you keep Millie beyond a
five minutes.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis enough of one another as
you&rsquo;ll get later on, like.&nbsp; Father, go you off
upstairs for your coat.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis hard work for me,
getting you all to act respectable, that &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>and</i> <span

<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp;
Millie&mdash;&rsquo;tis our wedding day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; And what if it is,
Andrew.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; Millie, it cuts me to
the heart to see your face all wet with tears.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; Did you think to see
it otherwise, Andrew?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; No smile upon your
lips, Millie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; Have I anything to
smile about, Andrew?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; No love coming from
your eyes, Mill.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; That you have never
seen, Andrew.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; And all changed in
the voice of you too.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; What do you mean by
that, Andrew?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; Listen,
Millie&mdash;&rsquo;tis a month since I last spoke with
you.&nbsp; Do you recollect?&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas the evening of the
great Fair.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span> And what if it was?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; Millie, you were
kinder to me that night than ever you had been before.&nbsp; I
seemed to see such a gentle look in your eyes then.&nbsp; And
when you spoke, &rsquo;twas as though&mdash;as
though&mdash;well&mdash;&rsquo;twas one of they quists a-cooing
up in the trees as I was put in mind of.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; Well, there&rsquo;s
nothing more to be said about that now, Andrew.&nbsp; That
night&rsquo;s over and done with.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve carried
the thought of it in my heart all this time, Millie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; I never asked you to,
Andrew.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve brought
you a nosegay of flowers, Mill.&nbsp; They be rare blossoms with
grand names what I can&rsquo;t recollect to all of them.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Millie</span> <i>takes the nosegay</i>,
<i>looks at it for an instant</i>, <i>and then lets it
fall</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; I have no liking for
flowers this day, Andrew.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; O Millie, and is it
so as you and me are going to our marriage?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; Yes, Andrew.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis so.&nbsp; I never said it could be different.&nbsp; I
have no heart to give you.&nbsp; My love was given long ago to
another.&nbsp; And that other has forgotten me by now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; O Millie, you shall
forget him too when once you are wed to me, I promise you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis beyond the
power of you or any man to make me do that, Andrew.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; Millie, what&rsquo;s
the good of we two going on to church one with t&rsquo;other?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no good
at all, Andrew.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; Millie, I could have
sworn that you had begun to care sommat more than ordinary for me
that last time we were together.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; Then you could have
sworn wrong.&nbsp; I care nothing for you, Andrew, no,
nothing.&nbsp; But I gave my word I&rsquo;d go to church with you
and be wed.&nbsp; And&mdash;I&rsquo;ll not break my word,
I&rsquo;ll not.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; And is this all that
you can say to me to-day, Mill?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; Yes, Andrew,
&rsquo;tis all.&nbsp; And now, &rsquo;tis very late, and I have
got to dress myself.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Calling loudly
from above</i>.]&nbsp; Millie, what are you stopping for?&nbsp;
Come you up here and get your gown on, do.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Millie</span> <i>looks haughtily at</i>
<span class="smcap">Andrew</span> <i>as she passes him</i>.&nbsp;
<i>She goes slowly out of the room</i>.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Andrew</span> <i>picks up the flowers and
stands holding them</i>, <i>looking disconsolately down upon
them</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">May</span> <i>comes in</i>,

<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; All alone, Andrew?&nbsp;
Has Millie gone to put her fine gown on?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; Yes, Millie&rsquo;s
gone to dress herself.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; O that&rsquo;s a
beautiful nosegay, Andrew.&nbsp; Was it brought for Mill?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; Yes, May, but she
won&rsquo;t have it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Millie don&rsquo;t like
you very much, Andrew, do she?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; Millie&rsquo;s got
quite changed towards me since last time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; And when was that,
Andrew?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; Why, last time was
the evening of the Fair, May.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; When I was hid in the
cupboard yonder, Andrew?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; So you were,
May.&nbsp; Well, can&rsquo;t you recollect how &rsquo;twas that
she spoke to me then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; O yes, Andrew, and that
I can.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas a quist a-cooing in the tree one
time&mdash;and then&mdash;she did recollect herself and did
sharpen up her tongue and &rsquo;twas another sort of bird what
could drive its beak into the flesh of anyone&mdash;so
&rsquo;twas.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; O May&mdash;you say
she did recollect herself&mdash;what do you mean by those
words?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; You see, she did give
her word that she would speak sharp and rough to you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; What are you talking
about, May?&nbsp; Do you mean that the tongue of her was not
speaking as the heart of her did feel?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; I guess &rsquo;twas
sommat like that, Andrew.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; O May, you have
gladdened me powerful by these words.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; But, O you must not tell
of me, Andrew.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; I will never do so,
May&mdash;only I shall know better how to be patient, and to keep
the spirit of me up next time that she do strike out against
me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not a-talking
of Mill, Andrew.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; Who are you talking
of then, I&rsquo;d like to know?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas Annet.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; What was?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Annet who was dressed up
in the cloak and bonnet of Millie that night and who did speak
with you so gentle and nice.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; Annet!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Is heard
calling</i>.]&nbsp; There, father, come along down and give your
face a wash at the pump.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s go quick
together into the garden, Andrew, and I&rsquo;ll tell you all
about it and how &rsquo;twas that Annet acted so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Drying her
eyes</i>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas&mdash;&rsquo;twas the scent out of
one of the flowers as got to my eyes, Uncle.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s a
likely tale it is.&nbsp; Hear that, Mother?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis with
her eyes that this little wench do snuff at a flower.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s good, bain&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t
patience with the wenches now-a-days.&nbsp; Lay down that nosegay
at once, Annet, and call your cousin from her room.&nbsp; I
warrant she has finished tricking of herself up by now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Ah, I warrant as
her&rsquo;ll need a smartish bit of time for to take the creases
out of the face of she.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Andrew</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">May</span> <i>come in</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Well, Andrew, my lad,
&rsquo;tis about time as we was on the way to church I
reckon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; I count as &rsquo;tis
full early yet, master.</p>
<p>[<i>He takes up the nosegay from the table and crosses the
room to the window where</i> <span class="smcap">Annet</span>
<i>is standing</i>, <i>and trying to control her tears</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; Annet, Millie will
have none of my blossoms.&nbsp; I should like it well if you
would carry them in your hand to church this day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking
wonderingly at him</i>.]&nbsp; Me, Andrew?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; Yes, you,
Annet.&nbsp; For, look you, they become you well.&nbsp; They have
sommat of the sweetness of you in them.&nbsp; And the touch of
them is soft and gentle.&nbsp; And&mdash;I would like you to keep
them in your hands this day, Annet.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; O Andrew, I never was
given anything like this before.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Slowly</i>.]&nbsp; I should like to give you a great deal
more, Annet&mdash;only I cannot.&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis got too
late.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Too late&mdash;I
should think it was.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s come to the maid!&nbsp;
In my time girls didn&rsquo;t use to spend a quarter of the while
afore the glass as they do now.&nbsp; Suppose you was to holler
for her again, Father.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Anything to please
you, Mother&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; I hear her coming,
Uncle.&nbsp; I hear the noise of the silk.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Millie</span> <i>comes slowly into the
room in her wedding clothes</i>.&nbsp; <i>She holds herself very
upright and looks from one to another quietly and coldly</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Andrew&rsquo;s gived
your nosegay to Annet, Millie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould have
been a pity to have wasted the fresh blossoms.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; But they were gathered
for you, Mill.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; Annet seems to like
them better than I did.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Well, my
wench&mdash;you be tricked out as though you was off to the horse
show.&nbsp; Mother, there bain&rsquo;t no one as can beat our
wench in looks anywhere this side of the country.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s right
enough in the clothing of her, but &rsquo;twould be better if her
looks did match the garments more.&nbsp; Come, Millie,
can&rsquo;t you appear pleasanter like on your wedding day?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m very
thirsty, Mother.&nbsp; Could I have a drink of water before we
set out?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; And what next, I
should like to know?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis only a
drink of water that I&rsquo;m asking for.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s
reasonable, Mother, bain&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Run along and get
some for your cousin, May.&nbsp; [<span class="smcap">May</span>
<i>runs out of the room</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Come you here,
Andrew, did you ever see a wench to beat ourn in looks, I
say?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Who has remained
near</i> <span class="smcap">Annet</span> <i>without
moving</i>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis very fine that Millie&rsquo;s
looking.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Fine, I should think
&rsquo;twas.&nbsp; You was a fine looking wench, Mother, the day
I took you to church, but &rsquo;tis my belief that Millie have
beat you in the appearance of her same as the roan heifer did
beat th&rsquo; old cow when the both was took along to
market.&nbsp; Ah, and did fetch very near the double of what I
gived for the dam.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">May</span> <i>returns carrying a glass
bowl full of water</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a drink of
cold water, Millie.&nbsp; I took it from the spring.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Millie</span> <i>takes the
bowl</i>.&nbsp; <i>At the same moment a loud knocking is heard at
the outside door</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s that,
I should like to know?</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Millie</span> <i>sets down the bowl on
the table</i>.&nbsp; <i>She listens with a sudden intent</i>,
<i>anxiety on her face as the knock is repeated</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll learn
anyone to come meddling with me on a day when &rsquo;tis marrying
going on.</p>
<p>[<i>The knocking is again heard</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">May</span>, <i>who would have opened the
door</i>.]&nbsp; No, no.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis I who will open the
door.</p>
<p>[<i>She raises the latch and flings the door wide
open</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Giles</span> <i>disguised as
a poor and bent old man</i>, <i>comes painfully into the
room</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t
want no beggars nor roadsters here to-day, if you please.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Ah, and that us
don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Us be a wedding party here, and &rsquo;tis for
you to get moving on, old man.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; He is poor and
old.&nbsp; And he has wandered far, in the heat of the
morning.&nbsp; Look at his sad clothing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Annet</span>.]&nbsp; I never heard her put so much
gentleness to her words afore.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis my
wedding day.&nbsp; He shall not go uncomforted from here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; I never knowed you
so careful of a poor wretch afore, Millie.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis quite
a new set out, this.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; I am in mind of
another, who may be wandering, and hungered, and in poor clothing
this day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Give him something
quick, Aunt, and let him get off so that we can start for the
wedding.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Coming close
to</i> <span class="smcap">Giles</span>.]&nbsp; What is it I can
do for you, master?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis only a
drink of water that I ask, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking up the
glass bowl</i>.]&nbsp; Only a drink of water, master?&nbsp; Then
take, and be comforted.</p>
<p>[<i>She holds the bowl before him for him to drink</i>.&nbsp;
<i>As he takes it</i>, <i>he drops a ring into the
water</i>.&nbsp; <i>He then drinks and hands the bowl back to</i>
<span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; <i>For a moment she
gazes speechless at the bottom of the bowl</i>.&nbsp; <i>Then she
lifts the ring from it and would drop the bowl but for</i> <span
class="smcap">May</span>, <i>who takes it from her</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; Master, from whom did
you get this?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; Look well at the
stones of it, mistress, for they are clouded and dim.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; And not more clouded
than the heart which is in me, master.&nbsp; O do you bring me
news?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; Is it not all too late
for news, mistress?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; Not if it be the news
for which my heart craves, master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; And what would that
be, mistress?</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Millie</span> <i>goes to</i> <span
class="smcap">Giles</span>, <i>and with both hands slowly pushes
back his big hat and gazes at him</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; O Giles, my true
love.&nbsp; You are come just in time.&nbsp; Another hour and I
should have been wed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; And so you knew me,
Mill?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; O Giles, no change of
any sort could hide you from the eyes of my love.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; Your love,
Millie.&nbsp; And is that still mine?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; It always has been
yours, Giles.&nbsp; O I will go with you so gladly in poor
clothing and in hunger all over the face of the earth.</p>
<p>[<i>She goes to him and clasps his arm</i>; <i>and</i>,
<i>standing by his side</i>, <i>faces all those in the
room</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Angrily</i>.]&nbsp; Please to come to your right senses,
Millie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Come, Andrew, set
your foot down as I&rsquo;ve set mine.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; Nay, master.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s naught left for me to say.&nbsp; The heart does
shew us better nor all words which way we have to travel.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; And are you going to
marry a beggar man instead of Andrew, who looks so brave and fine
in his wedding clothes, Millie?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; I am going to marry
him I have always loved, May&mdash;and&mdash;O Andrew, I never
bore you malice, though I did say cruel and hard words to you
sometimes.&mdash;But you&rsquo;ll not remember me
always&mdash;you will find gladness too, some day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; I count as I shall,
Millie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Come, come,
I&rsquo;ll have none of this&mdash;my daughter wed to a beggar
off the highway!&nbsp; Mother, &rsquo;tis time you had a word
here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; No, Father,
I&rsquo;ll leave you to manage this affair.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis you
who have spoiled Mill and brought her up so wayward and unruly,
and &rsquo;tis to you I look for to get us out of this unpleasant
position.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Dear
Millie&mdash;don&rsquo;t wed my brother Giles.&nbsp; Why, look at
his ragged smock and his bare feet.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; I shall be proud to
go bare too, so long as I am by his side, May.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Giles</span> <i>goes to the door and
blows his whistle three times and loudly</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that for,
Giles?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; You shall soon see,
little May.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be hanged
if I&rsquo;ll stand any more of this caddling nonsense.&nbsp;
Here, Mill&mdash;the trap&rsquo;s come to the door.&nbsp; Into it
with you, I say.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; I beg you to wait a
moment, master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp;
Wait!&mdash;&rsquo;Tis a sight too long as we have waited this
day.&nbsp; If all had been as I&rsquo;d planned, we should have
been to church by now.&nbsp; But womenfolk, there be no depending
on they.&nbsp; No, and that there bain&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">George</span>, <span
class="smcap">John</span> <i>and the</i> <span class="smcap">Old
Man</span> <i>come up</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">George</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">John</span> <i>carry their packets and the</i>
<span class="smcap">Old Man</span> <i>has</i> <span
class="smcap">Giles</span>&rsquo; <i>coat and hat over his
arm</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; And who are these
persons, Giles?</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">George</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">John</span> <i>set down their burdens on the floor
and begin to mop their faces</i>.&nbsp; <i>The</i> <span
class="smcap">Old Man</span> <i>stretches out his fine coat and
hat and buckled shoes to</i> <span
class="smcap">Giles</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span>.&nbsp; Here they be, my
lord, and I warrant as you&rsquo;ll feel more homely like in
they, nor what you&rsquo;ve got upon you now.&nbsp; [<span
class="smcap">Giles</span> <i>takes the things from him</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; Thank you, old
master.&nbsp; [<i>He turns to</i> <span
class="smcap">Millie</span>.]&nbsp; Let me go into the other
room, Millie.&nbsp; I will not keep you waiting longer than a few
moments.</p>
<p>[<i>He goes out</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">George</span>.]&nbsp; And who may you be, I should
like to know?&nbsp; You appear to be making very free with my
parlour.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; We be the servants
what wait upon Master Giles, old Missis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Old Missis,
indeed.&nbsp; Father, you shall speak to these persons.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Well, my men.&nbsp; I
scarce do know whether I be a-standing on my head or upon my
heels, and that&rsquo;s the truth &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Ah, and that I can
well understand, master, for I&rsquo;m a married man myself, and
my woman has a tongue to her head very similar to that of
th&rsquo; old missis yonder&mdash;so I know what &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Put them both out
of the door, Father, do you hear me?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis to the
cider as they&rsquo;ve been getting.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
clear.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; My good friends, what
is it that you carry in those bundles there?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis gold in
mine.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; And silver here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Depend upon it
&rsquo;tis two wicked thieves we have got among us, flying from
justice.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; No, no&mdash;did not
you hear them say, their master is Giles.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; And a better master
never trod the earth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; And a finer or a richer
gentleman I never want to see.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; Do you hear that,
Father?&nbsp; O you shocking liars&mdash;&rsquo;tis stolen goods
that you&rsquo;ve been and brought to our innocent house this
day.&nbsp; But, Father, do you up and fetch in the constable, do
you hear?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; O I&rsquo;ll run.&nbsp;
I shall love to see them going off to gaol.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; Be quiet, May.&nbsp;
Can&rsquo;t you all see how &rsquo;tis.&nbsp; Giles has done the
cruel hard task set him by Father&mdash;and is back again with
the bushel of silver and that of gold to claim my hand.&nbsp;
[<span class="smcap">Giles</span> <i>enters</i>.]&nbsp; But
Giles&mdash;I&rsquo;d have given it to you had you come to me
poor and forlorn and ragged, for my love has never wandered from
you in all this long time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; No, Giles&mdash;and
that it has not.&nbsp; Millie has never given me one kind word
nor one gentle look all the years that I&rsquo;ve been courting
of her, and that&rsquo;s the truth.&nbsp; And you can call
witness to it if you care.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giles</span>.&nbsp; Uncle, Aunt,
I&rsquo;ve done the task you set me years ago&mdash;and now I
claim my reward.&nbsp; I went from this house a poor wretch, with
nothing but the hopeless love in my heart to feed and sustain
me.&nbsp; I have returned with all that the world can give me of
riches and prosperity.&nbsp; Will you now let me be the husband
of your daughter?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; O say ye, Uncle, for
look how fine and grand he is in his coat&mdash;and the bags are
stuffed full to the brim and &rsquo;tis with gold and silver.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp;
Well&mdash;&rsquo;tis a respectabler end than I thought as
you&rsquo;d come to, Giles.&nbsp; And different nor what you
deserved.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Come, come,
Mother.&mdash;The fewer words to this, the better.&nbsp; Giles,
my boy&mdash;get you into the trap and take her along to the
church and drive smart.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; Annet&mdash;will you
come there with me too?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; O Andrew&mdash;what
are you saying?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Come, come.&nbsp;
Where&rsquo;s the wind blowing from now?&nbsp; Here, Mother, do
you listen to this.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; I shall be deaf
before I&rsquo;ve done, but it appears to me that Annet&rsquo;s
not lost any time in making the most of her chances.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Ah, and she be none
the worse for that.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis what we all likes to
do.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;d I be in the market if I did let my
chances blow by me?&nbsp; Hear that, Andrew?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a rare
lucky man this day, farmer.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; Ah, and &rsquo;tis a
rare good little wench, Annet&mdash;though she bain&rsquo;t so
showy as our&rsquo;n.&nbsp; A rare good little maid.&nbsp; And
now &rsquo;tis time we was all off to church, seeing as this is
to be a case of double harness like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; O Annet, you can&rsquo;t
be wed in that plain gown.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annet</span>.&nbsp; May, I&rsquo;m so
happy that I feel as though I were clothed all over with
jewels.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Andrew</span>.&nbsp; Give me your hand,
Annet.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Mockingly</i>.]&nbsp; Millie&mdash;don&rsquo;t you want to
give a drink of water to yon poor old man?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; That I will,
May?&nbsp; Here&mdash;fetch me something that&rsquo;s better than
water for him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have no
cider drinking out of meal times here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Millie</span>.&nbsp; Then &rsquo;twill I
have to be when we come back from church.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Old Man</span>.&nbsp; Bless you, my pretty
lady, but I be used to waiting.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll just sit me down
outside in the sun till you be man and wife.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;ll
not be till this day next year if this sort of thing goes on any
longer.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right,
Mother.&nbsp; You take and lead the way.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the
womenfolk as do keep we back from everything.&nbsp; But I knows
how to settle with they&mdash;[<i>roaring</i>]&mdash;come Mill,
come Giles, Andrew, Annet, May.&nbsp; Come Mother, out of
th&rsquo; house with all of you and to church, I say.</p>
<p>[<i>He gets behind them all and drives them before him and out

<h3>ACT I.&mdash;Scene 1.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>A wood</i>.&nbsp; <i>It is a
morning in June</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>, <i>carrying an empty
basket</i>, <i>comes slowly through the wood</i>.&nbsp; <i>On
reaching a fallen tree he sits down on it</i>, <i>placing his
basket on the ground</i>.&nbsp; <i>With his stick he absently
moves the grass and leaves that lie before him</i>, <i>and is so
deeply lost in his own thoughts that he does not hear the
approach of</i> <span class="smcap">Miles</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Luke</span> <i>until they are by his side</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the very
man to tell us all we want to know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; Why, if
&rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t George from Ox Lease.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">George</span> <i>half rises</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; No, sit you down
again, my lad, and we&rsquo;ll rest awhile by the side of
you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it,
Miles.&nbsp; Nothing couldn&rsquo;t have fallen out better for
us, I&rsquo;m thinking.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re about
right, Luke.&nbsp; Now, George, my man, we should very much
appreciate a few words with you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking up his
basket</i>.]&nbsp; Morning baint the time for words,
masters.&nbsp; I count as words will keep till the set of
sun.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis otherwise with work.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Work, why, George,
&rsquo;tis clear you are come out but to gather flowers this
morning.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the very
first time as ever I caught George an idling away of his time
like this.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis over to
Brook as I be going, masters, to fetch back a couple of young
chicken.&nbsp; Ourn be mostly old fowls, or pullets what do
lay.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; I never heard tell of
young chicken being ate up at Ox Lease afore July was in.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Nor me neither,
master.&nbsp; Never heared nor seed such a thing.&nbsp; But
mistress, her says, you can&rsquo;t sit a maid from town at table
unless there be poultry afore of she.&nbsp; They be rare nesh in
their feeding, maids from town, so mistress do say.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; That just brings us to
our little matter, George.&nbsp; When is it that you expect the
young lady?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; The boxes of they be
stacked mountains high in the bedroom since yesterday.&nbsp; And
I count as the maids will presently come on their own feet from
where the morning coach do set them down.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; Nay, but there&rsquo;s
only one maid what&rsquo;s expected.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Miss Clara,
what&rsquo;s master&rsquo;s sister; and the serving wench of
she.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Well, George,
&rsquo;twas a great day for your master when old Madam Lovel took
little Miss Clara to be bred up as one of the quality.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; A water plant do grow
best by the stream, and a blossom, from the meadows, midst the
grass.&nbsp; Let each sort bide in the place where &rsquo;twas
seeded.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; No, no, George, you
don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.&nbsp; A little
country wench may bloom into something very modish and elegant,
once taken from her humble home and set amongst carpets of velvet
and curtains of satin.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould be a
poor thing for any one to be so worked upon by curtains, nor yet
carpets, master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Take my word for it,
George, Ox Lease will have to smarten up a bit for this young
lady.&nbsp; I know the circles she has been moving in, and
&rsquo;tis to the best of everything that she has been used.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Rising</i>.]&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what mistress do say.&nbsp;
And that&rsquo;s why I be sent along down to Brook with haymaking
going on and all.&nbsp; Spring chicken with sparrow grass be the
right feeding for such as they.&nbsp; So mistress do count.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Stop a moment,
George.&nbsp; You have perhaps heard the letters from Miss Clara
discussed in the family from time to time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Miss Clara did never
send but two letters home in all the while she was gone.&nbsp;
The first of them did tell as how th&rsquo; old lady was dead and
had left all of her fortune to Miss Clara.&nbsp; And the second
was to say as how her was coming back to the farm this
morning.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; And hark you here,
George, was naught mentioned about Miss Clara&rsquo;s fine
suitors in neither of them letters?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; That I cannot say,
Master Jenner.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Nothing of their
swarming thick around her up in London, George?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; They may be swarming
by the thousand for aught as I do know.&nbsp; They smells gold as
honey bees do smell the blossom.&nbsp; Us&rsquo;ll have a good
few of them a-buzzing round the farm afore we&rsquo;re many hours
older, so I counts.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Well, George,
that&rsquo;ll liven up the place a bit, I don&rsquo;t doubt.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a bit of
quiet and no livening as Ox Lease do want.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t that
so, George, my lad?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Preparing to set
off</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll say good morning to you,
masters.&nbsp; I count I&rsquo;ve been and wasted a smartish time
already on the road.&nbsp; We be a bit hard pressed up at the
farm this day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; But George, my man, we
have a good many questions to ask of you before you set off.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Them questions will
have to bide till another time, I reckon.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m got
late already, master.</p>
<p>[<i>He hurries off</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Arriving by the
morning coach!&nbsp; I shall certainly make my call to the farm
before sunset.&nbsp; What do you say, Jenner?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a rich
man, Miles, and I am poor.&nbsp; But we have always been
friends.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; And our fathers before
us, Luke.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; And the courting of the
same maid shall not come between us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Slowly</i>.]&nbsp;
That&rsquo;ll be all right, Luke.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; What I do say is,
let&rsquo;s start fair.&nbsp; Neck to neck, like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; As you please, my good
Luke.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; Then, do you tell me
honest, shall I do in the clothes I&rsquo;m a-wearing of now,
Miles?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Regarding him
critically</i>.]&nbsp; That neckerchief is not quite the thing,
Luke.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis my Sunday
best.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Step over to the High
Street with me, my lad.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got something in the
shop that will be the very thing.&nbsp; You shall have it half
price for &rsquo;tis only a bit damaged in one of the
corners.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure
I&rsquo;m very much obliged to you, Miles.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all
right, Luke.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; George would look
better to my thinking if there was a new coat to the back of
him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Ah, poor beggar, he
would, and no mistake.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; I warrant as Emily do
keep it afore him as how he was took in from off the road by
th&rsquo; old farmer in his day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; I flatter myself that
I have a certain way with the ladies.&nbsp; They come to me
confidential like and I tell them what&rsquo;s what, and how
that, this or t&rsquo;other is worn about town.&nbsp; But with
Missis Spring &rsquo;tis different.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a woman I
could never get the right side of no how.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; Ah, poor Thomas!&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a man who goes down trod and hen scratched if you
like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis altogether
a very poor place up at Ox Lease, for young Miss.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Pulling out his
watch</i>.]&nbsp; Time&rsquo;s slipping on.&nbsp; What if we were
to stroll on to the shop and see about my neckerchief, Miles?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure
I&rsquo;m quite agreeable, Luke.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill help to pass
away the morning.</p>
<p>[<i>He puts his arm in</i> <span
class="smcap">Luke&rsquo;s</span> <i>and they go briskly off in
the direction of the village</i>.</p>
<h3>ACT I.&mdash;Scene 2.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>, <i>followed by</i> <span
class="smcap">Joan</span>, <i>comes through the wood</i>.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>is dressed in a long</i>,
<i>rich cloak and wears a bonnet that is brightly trimmed with
feathers and ribbons</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Joan</span>
<i>wears a cotton bonnet and small shawl</i>.&nbsp; <i>She
carries her mistress&rsquo;s silken bag over her arm</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Pointing to the
fallen tree</i>.]&nbsp; There is the very resting place for
us.&nbsp; We will sit down under the trees for a while.&nbsp;
[<i>She seats herself</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Dusting the tree
with her handkerchief before she sits on it</i>.]&nbsp; Have we
much further to go, mistress?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Only a mile or two, so
far as I can remember.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis rough work
for the feet, down in these parts, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; If London roads were
paved with diamonds I&rsquo;d sooner have my feet treading this
rugged way that leads to home.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; What sort of a place
shall we find it when we gets there, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; I was but seven when I
left them all, Joan.&nbsp; And that is fourteen years ago
to-day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; So many years may bring
about some powerful big changes, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; But I dream that I
shall find all just as it was when I went away.&nbsp; Only that
Gran&rsquo;ma won&rsquo;t be there.</p>
<p>[<i>There is a short silence during which</i> <span
class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>seems lost in thought</i>.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>flicks the dust off her shoes
with a branch of leaves</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the coaches
I do miss down in these parts.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; I would not have
driven one step of the way this morning, Joan.&nbsp; In my fancy
I have been walking up from the village and through the wood and
over the meadows since many a day.&nbsp; I have not forgotten one
turn of the path.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; The road has not
changed then, mistress?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; But it does
not seem quite so broad or so fine as I remembered it to
be.&nbsp; That is all.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; And very likely the
house won&rsquo;t seem so fine neither, mistress, after the grand
rooms which you have been used to.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; What company shall we
see there, mistress?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Well, there&rsquo;s
Thomas, he is my brother, and Emily his wife.&nbsp; Then the two
children.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>After a short
silence</i>, <i>and as though to herself</i>.]&nbsp; And there
was George.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; Yes, mistress</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Georgie seemed so big
and tall to me in those days.&nbsp; I wonder how old he really
was, when I was seven.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; Would that be a younger
brother of yours, like, mistress</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; No, George minded the
horses and looked after the cows and poultry.&nbsp; Sometimes he
would drive me into market with him on a Saturday.&nbsp; And in
the evenings I would follow him down to the pool to see the
cattle watered.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m mortal
afeared of cows, mistress.&nbsp; I could never abide the sight
nor the sound of those animals.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll soon get
over that, Joan.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t care
for poultry neither, very much.&nbsp; I goes full of fear when I
hears one of they old turkey cocks stamping about.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Pulling up the
sleeve of her left arm</i>.]&nbsp; There, do you see this little
scar?&nbsp; I was helping George to feed the ducks and geese when
the fierce gander ran after me and knocked me down and took a
piece right out of my arm.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking intently on
the scar</i>.]&nbsp; I have often seen that there mark,
mistress.&nbsp; And do you think as that old gander will be
living along of the poultry still?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; I wish he might be,
Joan.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; What with the cows and
the horses and the ganders, we shall go with our lives in our
hands, as you might say.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>As though to
herself</i>.]&nbsp; When the days got colder, we would sit under
the straw rick, George and I.&nbsp; And he would sing to
me.&nbsp; Some of his songs, I could say off by heart this
day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking nervously
upward</i>.]&nbsp; O do look at that nasty little thing dropping
down upon us from a piece of thread silk.&nbsp; Who ever put such
a thing up in the tree I&rsquo;d like to know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Brushing it gently
aside</i>.]&nbsp; That won&rsquo;t hurt you&mdash;a tiny
caterpillar.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>After a
moment</i>.]&nbsp; What more could the farm hand do,
mistress?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; He would clasp on his
bells and dance in the Morris on certain days, Joan.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis to be hoped
as there&rsquo;ll be some dancing or something to liven us all up
a bit down here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Why, Joan, I believe
you&rsquo;re tired already of the country.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis so powerful
quiet and heavy like, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis full of
sounds.&nbsp; Listen to the doves in the trees and the lambs
calling from the meadow.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d sooner have
the wheels of the coaches and the cries upon the street, and the
door bell a ringing every moment and fine gentlemen and ladies
being shewn up into the parlour.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Stretching out her
arms</i>.]&nbsp; O how glad I am to be free of all that.&nbsp;
And most of all, how glad to be ridded of one person.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; His lordship will
perhaps follow us down here, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; No, I have forbidden
it.&nbsp; I must have a month of quiet, and he is to wait that
time for his answer.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; O mistress,
you&rsquo;ll never disappoint so fine a gentleman.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; You forget that Lord
Lovel and I have played together as children.&nbsp; It is as a
brother that I look upon him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; His lordship
don&rsquo;t look upon you as a sister, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Rising</i>.]&nbsp;
That is a pity, Joan.&nbsp; But see, it is getting late and we
must be moving onwards.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>rises and smoothes and
shakes out her skirt</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Here, loosen my cloak,
Joan, and untie the ribbons of my bonnet.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; O mistress, keep the
pretty clothes upon you till you have got to the house.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; No, no&mdash;such town
garments are not suited to the woods and meadows.&nbsp; I want to
feel the country breeze upon my head, and my limbs must be free
from the weight of the cloak.&nbsp; I had these things upon me
during the coach journey.&nbsp; They are filled with road dust
and I dislike them now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Unfastening the
cloak and untying the bonnet</i>.]&nbsp; They are fresh and
bright for I brushed and shook them myself this morning.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Retying a blue
ribbon which she wears in her hair</i>.]&nbsp; I have taken a
dislike to them.&nbsp; See here, Joan, since you admire them,
they shall be yours.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; Mine?&nbsp; The French
bonnet and the satin cloak?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; To comfort you for the
pains of the country, Joan.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; O mistress, let us stop
a moment longer in this quiet place so that I may slip them on
and see how they become me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; As you will.&nbsp;
Listen, that is the cuckoo singing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Throwing off her
cotton bonnet and shawl and dressing herself hastily in the
bonnet and cloak</i>.]&nbsp; O what must it feel like to be a
grand lady and wear such things from dawn to bed time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; I am very glad to be
without them for a while.&nbsp; How good the air feels on my
head.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; There, mistress, how do
I look?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Very nicely,
Joan.&nbsp; So nicely that if you like, you may keep them upon
you for the remainder of the way.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; O mistress, may I
really do so?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; And Joan,
do you go onwards to the farm by the quickest path which is
through this wood and across the high road.&nbsp; Anyone will
shew you where the place is.&nbsp; I have a mind to wander about
in some of the meadows which I remember.&nbsp; But I will join
you all in good time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; Very well,
mistress.&nbsp; If I set off in a few moments it will do, I
suppose?&nbsp; I should just like to take a peep at myself as I
am now, in the little glass which you carry in your silk bag.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Going
off</i>.]&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t spend too much time looking at what
will be shewn you, Joan.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; Never fear,
mistress.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be there afore you, if I have to run
all the way.&nbsp; [<span class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>wanders
off</i>.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>sits down again on the
trunk of the fallen tree</i>.&nbsp; <i>She opens the silken
bag</i>, <i>draws out a small hand glass and looks long and
steadily at her own reflection</i>.&nbsp; <i>Then she glances
furtively around and</i>, <i>seeing that she is quite alone</i>,
<i>she takes a small powder box from the bag and hastily opening
it</i>, <i>she gives her face several hurried touches with the
powder puff</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Surveying the
effect in the glass</i>.]&nbsp; Just to take off the brown of my
freckles.&nbsp; Now if any one was to come upon me sitting here
they wouldn&rsquo;t know as I was other than a real, high
lady.&nbsp; All covered with this nice cloak as I be, the French
bonnet on my head, and powder to my face, who&rsquo;s to tell the
difference?&nbsp; But O&mdash;these must be hid first.</p>
<p>[<i>She perceives her cotton bonnet and little shawl on the
ground</i>.&nbsp; <i>She hastily rolls them up in a small bundle
and stuffs them into the silken bag</i>.&nbsp; <i>Then she takes
up the glass and surveys herself again</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; How should I act now if
some grand gentleman was to come up and commence talking to
me?&nbsp; Perhaps he might even take me for a lady of title in
these fine clothes, and &rsquo;twould be a pity to have to
undeceive him.</p>
<p>[<i>She arranges her hair a little under the bonnet and then
lowers the lace veil over her face</i>.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Miles</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Luke</span> <i>come slowly up behind her</i>.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Miles</span> <i>nudges</i> <span
class="smcap">Luke</span> <i>with his elbow</i>, <i>signing to
him to remain where he is whilst he steps forward in front of</i>
<span class="smcap">Joan</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Pardon me, madam, but
you appear to have mistook the way.&nbsp; Allow me to set you on
the right path for Ox Lease.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Letting the mirror
fall on her lap and speaking very low</i>.]&nbsp; How do you know
I am going to Ox Lease, sir?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; You see, madam, I
happen to know that a stylish young miss from town is expected
there to-day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Coming forward and
speaking in a loud whisper</i>.]&nbsp; Now Miles.&nbsp; I count
as you made one of the biggest blunders of the time.&nbsp; Our
young lady be journeying along of her servant wench.&nbsp; This
one baint she.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; If we have made a
small error, madam, allow me to beg your pardon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t mention it,
sir.&nbsp; Everyone is mistaken sometimes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;m
powerful sorry if we have given any offence, mam.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking up at</i>
<span class="smcap">Luke</span> <i>with sudden boldness and
speaking in a slow</i>, <i>affected voice</i>.]&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s nothing to make so much trouble about, sir.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Can we be of any
assistance to you, madam?&nbsp; The wood may appear rather dense
at this point.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; That it does.&nbsp;
Dense and dark&mdash;and the pathway!&nbsp; My goodness, but my
feet have never travelled over such rough ground before.</p>
<p>Muss.&nbsp; That I am sure of, madam.&nbsp; I have no doubt
that the delicate texture of your shoes has been sadly treated by
our stones and ruts.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Insensibly pulling
her skirts over her thick walking shoes</i>.]&nbsp; Well,
it&rsquo;s vastly different to London streets, where I generally
take exercise&mdash;at least when I&rsquo;m not a-riding in the
coach.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; The country is but a
sad place at the best, Miss Clara Spring.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking round
furtively and speaking in a whisper</i>.]&nbsp; O, how did you
guess my&mdash;my name?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; Come,
&rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t a hard matter, that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Missey can command my
services.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Rallying</i>,
<i>and standing up</i>.]&nbsp; Then gentlemen, do you walk a bit
of the road with me and we could enjoy some conversation as we go
along.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Offering his
arm</i>.]&nbsp; You take my arm, Miss Clara&mdash;do&mdash;.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Also offering his
arm</i>.]&nbsp; I shall also give myself the pleasure of
supporting Miss.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking an arm of
each</i>.]&nbsp; O thank you, kindly gentlemen.&nbsp; Now we
shall journey very comfortably, I am sure.</p>
<p>[<i>They all set out walking in the direction of the
farm</i>.</p>
<h3>ACT II.&mdash;Scene 1.</h3>
<p><i>The kitchen of Ox Lease Farm</i>.&nbsp; <i>There are three
doors</i>.&nbsp; <i>One opens to the staircase</i>, <i>one to the
garden and a third into the back kitchen</i>.&nbsp; <i>At a table
in the middle of the room</i> <span class="smcap">Emily</span>
<i>stands ironing some net window curtains</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Jessie</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Robin</span> <i>lean against the table watching
her</i>.&nbsp; <i>By the open doorway</i>, <i>looking out on the
garden</i>, <i>stands</i> <span class="smcap">Thomas</span>, <i>a
mug of cider in one hand and a large slice of bread in the
other</i>.&nbsp; <i>As he talks</i>, <i>he takes alternate drinks
and bites</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Speaking in a
shrill</i>, <i>angry voice</i>.]&nbsp; Now Thomas, suppose you
was to take that there bread a step further away and eat it in
the garden, if eat it you must, instead of crumbling it all over
my clean floor.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you be so
testy, Emily.&nbsp; The dogs&rsquo;ll lick the crumbs up as clean
as you like presently.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Dogs?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
like to see the dog as&rsquo;ll shew its nose in here to-day when
I&rsquo;ve got it all cleaned up against the coming of fine young
madam.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Finishing his
bread and looking wistfully at his empty hand</i>.]&nbsp; The
little maid&rsquo;ll take a brush and sweep up her daddy&rsquo;s
crumbs, now, won&rsquo;t her?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give it to
any one who goes meddling in my brush cupboard now that
I&rsquo;ve just put all in order against the prying and nozzling
of the good-for-nothing baggage what&rsquo;s coming along with
your sister.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s baggage,
Mother?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Sharply</i>.]&nbsp; Never you mind.&nbsp; Get and take your
elbow off my ironing sheet.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking at her
father</i>.]&nbsp; I count as you&rsquo;d like a piece more
bread, Dad?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Well, I don&rsquo;t
say but &rsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t come amiss.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
hungry work in th&rsquo; hayfield.&nbsp; And us be to go without
our dinners this day, isn&rsquo;t that so, Emily?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Slamming down her
iron on the stand</i>.]&nbsp; If I&rsquo;ve told you once,
I&rsquo;ve told you twenty times, &rsquo;twas but the one pair of
hands as I was gived at birth.&nbsp; Now, what have you got to
say against that, Thomas?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Sheepishly</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; And if so be as
I&rsquo;m to clean and wash and cook, and run, and wait, and
scour, and mend, for them lazy London minxes, other folk must go
without hot cooking at mid-day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Faintly</i>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t nothing cooked,
like.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas a bit of bread as I did ask for.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Getting
up</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll get it for you, Dad.&nbsp; I know where
the loaf bides and the knife too.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll cut you, O
such a large piece.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Seizing her
roughly by the hand</i>.]&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll do nothing of the
sort.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll take this here cold iron into Maggie and
you&rsquo;ll bring back one that is hot.&nbsp; How am I to get
these curtains finished and hung and all, by the time the dressed
up parrots come sailing in, I&rsquo;d like to know.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Jessie</span> <i>runs away with the
iron</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Setting down his
mug and coming to the table</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;d leave the
windows bare if it was me, Emily.&nbsp; The creeping rose do form
the suitablest shade for they, to my thinking.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; That shews how much
you know about it, Thomas.&nbsp; No, take your hands from off my
table.&nbsp; Do you think as I wants dirty thumbs shewing all
over the clean net what I&rsquo;ve washed and dried and ironed,
and been a-messing about with since &rsquo;twas light?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Now that&rsquo;s what
I be trying for to say.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no need for you to go
and work yourself into the fidgets, Emily, because of little
Clara coming back.&nbsp; Home&rsquo;s home.&nbsp; And
&rsquo;twon&rsquo;t be neither the curtains nor the hot dinner as
Clara will be thinking of when her steps into th&rsquo; old place
once more.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Running back with
the hot iron which she sets down on the table</i>.]&nbsp; What
will Aunt Clara be thinking of then, Dad?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Shy and abashed
under a withering glance from</i> <span
class="smcap">Emily</span> <i>who has taken up the iron and is
slamming it down on the net</i>.]&nbsp; Her&rsquo;ll remember,
very like, how &rsquo;twas when her left&mdash;some fourteen year
ago.&nbsp; And her&rsquo;ll have her eyes on
Gran&rsquo;ma&rsquo;s chair, what&rsquo;s empty.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; I should be thinking
of the hot fowl and sparrow grass what&rsquo;s for dinner.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; And her&rsquo;ll look
up to th&rsquo; old clock, and different things what&rsquo;s
still in their places.&nbsp; The grand parts where she have been
bred up will be forgot.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill be only home as
her&rsquo;ll think on.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t
patience to listen to such stuff.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; [<i>After a
pause</i>.]&nbsp; I count that &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t likely as a
young woman what&rsquo;s been left riches as Clara have, would
choose to make her home along of such as we for always, like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; We have perches and
plenty of them for barn door poultry, but when it comes to
roosting spangled plumes and fancy fowls, no thank you, Thomas,
I&rsquo;m not going to do it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; Do let us get and
roost some fancy fowls, Mother.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; What are spangled
plumes, Mother?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Viciously</i>.]&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll see plenty of them
presently.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; Will Aunt Clara bring
the fowls along of she?</p>
<p>[<i>A slight pause during which</i> <span
class="smcap">Emily</span> <i>irons vigorously</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>As she
irons</i>.]&nbsp; Some folk have all the honey.&nbsp; It do
trickle from the mouths of them and down to the ground.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; Has Aunt Clara got her
mouth very sticky, then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; And there be others
what are born to naught but crusts and the vinegar.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; Like you,
Mother&mdash;Least, that&rsquo;s what Maggie said this
morning.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; That &rsquo;twas in
the vinegar jar as your tongue had growed, Mother.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll learn that
wench to keep her thoughts to herself if she can&rsquo;t fetch
them out respectful like.&nbsp; [<i>Shouting</i>.]&nbsp; Mag,
come you here this minute&mdash;what are you after now, I&rsquo;d
like to know, you ugly, idle piece of mischief?</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Maggie</span>, <i>wiping a plate comes
from the back kitchen</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; Was you calling,
mistress?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s this
you&rsquo;ve got saying to Miss Jessie, I should like to
know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Running to</i>
<span class="smcap">Maggie</span> <i>and laying her hand on her
arm</i>.]&nbsp; Dear Maggie, &rsquo;tis only what you did tell
about poor mother&rsquo;s tongue being in the vinegar jar.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; O Miss Jessie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Hark you here, my
girl&mdash;if &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t hay time you should bundle up
your rags and off with you this minute.&nbsp; But as &rsquo;tis
awkward being short of a pair of hands just now, you&rsquo;ll
bide a week or two and then you&rsquo;ll get outside of my door
with no more character to you nor what I took you with.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Come, come
Emily.&nbsp; The girl&rsquo;s a good one for to work, and that
she is.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Be quiet,
Thomas.&nbsp; This is my business, and you&rsquo;ll please to
keep your words till they&rsquo;re wanted.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; O mistress, I
didn&rsquo;t mean no harm, I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want no
words nor no tears neither.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Beginning to cry
loudly</i>.]&nbsp; I be the only girl as have stopped with you
more nor a month, I be.&nbsp; T&rsquo;others wouldn&rsquo;t bide
a day, some of them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Be quiet.&nbsp; Back
to your work with you.&nbsp; And when the hay is all carried, off
with you, ungrateful minx, to where you came from.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; O let us keep her
always, Mother, she&rsquo;s kind.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you cry,
Mag.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll marry you when I&rsquo;m a big man like
Daddy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Harken to them,
Emily!&nbsp; She&rsquo;s been a good maid to the children.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d not part with any one so hasty, if &rsquo;twas me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Very
angrily</i>.]&nbsp; When I want your opinion, Thomas, I&rsquo;ll
ask for it.&nbsp; Suppose you was to go out and see after
something which you do understand.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; O I&rsquo;ll go down
to the field fast enough, I can tell you.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas only
being hungered as drove me into the hornets&rsquo; nest, as you
might say.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Ironing
fiercely</i>.]&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; I did
only say as I was a-going back to the field when George do come
home.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; There again.&nbsp; Did
you ever know the man to be so slow before.&nbsp; I warrant as he
have gone drinking or mischiefing down at the Spotted Cow instead
of coming straight home with they chicken.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Nay, nay.&nbsp;
George is not the lad to do a thing like that.&nbsp; A quieter
more well bred up lad nor George never trod in shoes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span> [<i>Glancing at</i> <span
class="smcap">Maggie</span>.]&nbsp; What are you tossing your
head like that for, Maggie?&nbsp; Please to recollect as
you&rsquo;re a lazy, good-for-nothing little slut of a maid
servant, and not a circus pony all decked out for the show.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; Maggie&rsquo;s fond
of Georgie.&nbsp; And Georgie&rsquo;s kind to Mag.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Fearfully</i>.]&nbsp; O don&rsquo;t, Miss Jessie, for
goodness sake.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Viciously</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll soon put an end to anything
in that quarter.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Now, Emily&mdash;take
it quiet.&nbsp; Why, we shall have Clara upon us before us knows
where we are.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Folding the
curtains</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll settle her too, if she comes
before I&rsquo;m ready for her.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Pointing through
the open</i>.]&nbsp; There&rsquo;s George, coming with the
basket.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">George</span> <i>comes into the
room</i>.&nbsp; <i>He carefully rubs his feet on the mat as he
enters</i>.&nbsp; <i>Then he advances to the table</i>.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Maggie</span> <i>dries her eyes with the back
of her hand</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Jessie</span> <i>is
standing with her arm in</i> <span
class="smcap">Maggie&rsquo;s</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Well, and where have
you been all this while, I&rsquo;d like to know?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; To Brook Farm, mam,
and home.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve been up
to some mischief on the way, I warrant.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Come, Emily.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">George</span> <i>looks calmly into</i>
<span class="smcap">Emily&rsquo;s</span> <i>face</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Then his gaze travels leisurely round the room</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; I was kept waiting
while they did pluck and dress the chicken.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Lifting the cloth
covering the basket</i>, <i>and looking within it</i>.]&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d best have gone myself.&nbsp; Of all the thick-headed
men I ever did see, you&rsquo;re the thickest.&nbsp; Upon my word
you are.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s wrong
now, mistress?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Taint chicken
at all what you&rsquo;ve been and fetched me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be blowed
if I do know what &rsquo;tis then.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; If I&rsquo;d been
given a four arms and legs at birth same as th&rsquo; horses,
I&rsquo;d have left a pair of them at home and gone and done the
job myself, I would.&nbsp; And then you should see what I&rsquo;d
have brought back.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t
better what I&rsquo;ve got here.&nbsp; From the weight it might
be two fat capons.&nbsp; So it might.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Seizing the basket
roughly</i>.]&nbsp; Here, Mag, off into the pantry with
them.&nbsp; A couple of skinny frogs from out the road ditch
would have done as well.&nbsp; And you, Jess, upstairs with these
clean curtains and lay them careful on the bed.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
put them to the windows later.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; George, my boy, did
you meet with any one on the way, like?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d best ask
no questions if you don&rsquo;t want to be served with lies,
Thomas.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Throwing a glance
of disdain at</i> <span class="smcap">Emily</span>.]&nbsp; Miles
Hooper and Farmer Jenner was taking the air &rsquo;long of one
another in the wood, master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Miles Hooper and Luke
a-taking of the air, and of a weekday morning!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; That they was,
master.&nbsp; And they did stop I&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Ah, now you&rsquo;ve
got it, Thomas.&nbsp; Now we shall know why George was upon the
road the best part of the day and me kept waiting for the
chicken.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Steadily</i>.]&nbsp; Sunday clothes to the back of both of
them.&nbsp; And, when was Miss Clara expected up at home.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Ah, &rsquo;tis a fair
commotion all over these parts already, I warrant.&nbsp; There
wasn&rsquo;t nothing else spoke of in market last time, but how
as sister Clara with all her money was to come home.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Coming
back</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve laid the curtains on the bed, shall I
gather some flowers and set them on the table, mother?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to see
you!&nbsp; Flowers in the bedroom?&nbsp; I never heard tell of
such senseless goings on.&nbsp; What next, I&rsquo;d like to
know?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Miss Clara always did
fill a mug of clover blooms and set it aside of her bed when her
was a little thing&mdash;so high.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; Do you remember our
fine aunt, then, Georgie?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; I remembers Miss
Clara right enough.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
flatter yourself, George, as such a coxsy piece of town goods
will trouble herself to remember you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; The little maid had a
good enough heart to her afore she was took away from us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; Do you think our aunt
Clara has growed into a coxsy town lady, George?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; No, I do not, Miss
Jessie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Beginning to stir
about noisily as she sets the kitchen in order</i>.]&nbsp; Get
off with you to the field, Thomas, can&rsquo;t you.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve had enough to do as &rsquo;tis without a great hulking
man standing about and taking up all the room.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Come, George,
us&rsquo;ll clear out down to th&rsquo; hay field, and snatch a
bite as we do go.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it,
master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Calling angrily
after them</i>.]&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no dinner for no one to-day,
I tell you.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Thomas</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">George</span> <i>go out of the back kitchen
door</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Emily</span> <i>begins
putting the irons away</i>, <i>folding up the ironing sheet and
setting the chairs back against the wall</i>.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Jessie</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Robin</span>, <i>from their places at the
table</i>, <i>watch her intently</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>As she moves
about</i>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t be half the upset if the
wench was coming by herself, but to have a hussy of a serving
maid sticking about in the rooms along of us, is more nor I can
stand.</p>
<p>[<i>She begins violently to sweep up the hearth</i>.</p>
<p>[<i>Steps are heard outside</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; Hark, what&rsquo;s
that, mother?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give it to
any one who wants to come in here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Running to the
open door</i>.]&nbsp; They&rsquo;re coming up the path.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis our fine auntie and two grand gentlemen either side of
she.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Running also to
the door</i>.]&nbsp; O I want to look on her too.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Putting the broom
in a corner</i>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis no end to the vexation.&nbsp;
But she&rsquo;ll have to wait on herself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve no
time to play the dancing bear.&nbsp; And that I&rsquo;ve not.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Joan</span>, <i>between</i> <span
class="smcap">Miles Hooper</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Luke Jenner</span>, <i>comes up to the open
door</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To
Jessie</i>.]&nbsp; See here, my little maid, what&rsquo;ll you
give Mister Hooper for bringing this pretty lady safe up to the
farm?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; I know who &rsquo;tis
you&rsquo;ve brought.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis my Aunt Clara.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a smart
little wench, if ever there was one.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; I know who &rsquo;tis,
too, &rsquo;cause of the spangled plumes in the bonnet of
she.&nbsp; Mother said as there&rsquo;d be some.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Coming
forward</i>.]&nbsp; Well, Clara, if &rsquo;twas by the morning
coach as you did come, you&rsquo;re late.&nbsp; If &rsquo;twas by
th&rsquo; evening one, you&rsquo;re too soon by a good few
hours.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Having come by the
morning coach, Miss Clara had the pleasant fancy to stroll here
through the woodlands, Missis Spring.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; Ah, and &rsquo;twas
lost on the way as we did find her, like a strayed sheep.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; And ours has been the
privilege to bring the fair wanderer safely home.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Scornfully
looking</i> <span class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>over from head to
foot</i>.]&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s that serving wench of yours got
to, Clara?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Our young missy had a
wish for solitude.&nbsp; She sent her maid on by another
road.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; The good-for-nothing
hussy.&nbsp; I warrant as she have found something of mischief
for her idle hands to do.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; If I may venture to
say so, our Miss Clara is somewhat fatigued by her long
stroll.&nbsp; London young ladies are very delicately framed,
Missis Spring.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Pointing
ungraciously</i>.]&nbsp; There&rsquo;s chairs right in front of
you.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Miles</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Luke</span> <i>lead</i> <span
class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>forward</i>, <i>placing her in an
armchair with every attention</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>sinks into it</i>, <i>and</i>,
<i>taking a little fan from the silken bag on her arm</i>,
<i>begins to fan herself violently</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Watching her with
fierce contempt</i>.]&nbsp; Maybe as you&rsquo;d like my kitchen
wench to come and do that for you, Clara, seeing as your fine
maid is gadding about the high roads instead of minding what it
concerns her to attend to.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Faintly</i>.]&nbsp;
O no, thank you.&nbsp; The day is rather warm&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Warm, I should think
it was warm in under of that great white curtain.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; Aunt Clara, I&rsquo;m
Jessie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; Are you, my dear?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m
Robin.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Now, I wager, if you
are both good little children, this pretty lady will give you
each a kiss.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Faintly</i>.]&nbsp;
To be sure I will.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; Then you&rsquo;ll
have to take off that white thing from your face.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis like what mother do spread over the currant bushes to
keep the birds from the fruit.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>slowly raises her
veil</i>, <i>showing her face</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; Shall I give you a
kiss, Aunt?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d be careful
if I was you, Jess.&nbsp; Fine ladies be brittle as fine
china.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; O I&rsquo;ll kiss her
very lightly, Mother.</p>
<p>[<i>She goes up to</i> <span class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>and
kisses her</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Robin</span> <i>then
reaches up his face and</i> <span class="smcap">Joan</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Rubbing his
mouth</i>.]&nbsp; The flour do come from Aunt same as it does
from a new loaf.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Joan</span>.]&nbsp; You must pardon these ignorant
little country brats, Miss Clara.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; O there&rsquo;s nothing
amiss, thank you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Amiss, who said as
there was?&nbsp; When folks what can afford to lodge at the inn
do come down and fasten theirselves on the top of poor people,
they must take things as they do find them and not start
grumbling at the first set off.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; There, there, Missis
Spring.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t naught said about
grumbling.&nbsp; But Miss Clara have come a smartish long
distance, and it behoves us all as she should find summat of a
welcome at the end of her journey, like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Aside to</i> <span
class="smcap">Joan</span>.]&nbsp; How strange this country tongue
must fall on your ears, Miss Clara!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
understand about half of what they say.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Overhearing
her</i>.]&nbsp; O, you don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t you.&nbsp; Well,
Clara, I was always one for plain words, and I say &rsquo;tis a
pity when folks do get above the position to which they was bred,
and for all the fine satins and plumes upon you, the body
what&rsquo;s covered by them belongs to Clara Spring,
what&rsquo;s sister to Thomas.&nbsp; And all the world knows what
Thomas is&mdash;A poor, mean spirited, humble born man with but
two coats to the back of him, and with not a thought to the mind
of him which is not foolishness.&nbsp; And I judge from by what
they be in birth, and not by the bags of gold what have been left
them by any old madams in their dotage.&nbsp; So now you see how
I takes it all and you and me can start fair, like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Luke</span>.]&nbsp; O Mister&mdash;Mister Jenner, I
feel so faint.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking her
fan</i>.]&nbsp; Allow me.&nbsp; [<i>He begins to fan
her</i>.]&nbsp; I assure you she means nothing by it.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s her way.&nbsp; You see, she knows no better.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d fetch out
summat for her to eat if I was you, missis.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
famished as the poor young maid must be.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; She should have come
when &rsquo;twas meal time then.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t hold with
bites nor drinks in between whiles.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; O I&rsquo;m dying for a
glass of milk&mdash;or water would do as well.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; My dear young
lady&mdash;anything to oblige.&nbsp; [<i>Turning to
Jessie</i>.]&nbsp; Come, my little maid, see if you can&rsquo;t
make yourself useful in bringing a tray of refreshment for your
auntie.&nbsp; And you [<i>turning to Robin</i>] trot off and help
sister.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Not if I know
it.&nbsp; Stop where you are, Jess.&nbsp; Robin, you dare to
move.&nbsp; If Clara wants to eat and drink I&rsquo;m afeared she
must wait till supper time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; There be chicken and
sparrow grass for supper, Aunt.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; And a great pie of
gooseberries.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Faintly</i>.]&nbsp;
O I couldn&rsquo;t touch a mouthful of food, don&rsquo;t speak to
me about it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; I likes talking of
dinner.&nbsp; After I&rsquo;ve done eating of it, I likes next
best to talk about it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; See here, missis.&nbsp;
Let&rsquo;s have a glass of summat cool for Miss Clara.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Calling
angrily</i>.]&nbsp; Maggie, Maggie, where are you, you great
lazy-boned donkey?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Comes in from the
back kitchen</i>, <i>her apron held to her eyes</i>.]&nbsp; Did
you call me, mistress?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Get up a bucket of
water from the well.&nbsp; Master&rsquo;s sister wants a
drink.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Between
sobs</i>.]&nbsp; Shall I bring it in the bucket, or would the
young lady like it in a jug?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>With
exasperation</i>.]&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no end to the worriting
that other folks do make.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; Let me go and help
poor Maggie, mother.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Joan</span>.]&nbsp; Do you know what Maggie&rsquo;s
crying for, Aunt Clara?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I
don&rsquo;t, little boy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis because
she&rsquo;s got to go.&nbsp; Mother&rsquo;s sent her off.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twas what she said of mother&rsquo;s tongue.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Roughly taking
hold of</i> <span class="smcap">Robin</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Jessie</span>.]&nbsp; Come you along with me, you
ill-behaved little varmints.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the back kitchen
and the serving maid as is the properest place for such as
you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not have you bide &rsquo;mongst the company
no longer.&nbsp; [<i>She goes out with the children and followed
by</i> <span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.]</p>
<p>[<i>Directly they have left the room</i> <span
class="smcap">Joan</span>, <i>whose manner has been nervously
shrinking</i>, <i>seems to recover herself and she assumes a
languid</i>, <i>artificial air</i>, <i>badly imitating the ways
of a lady of fashion</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Fanning herself
with her handkerchief and her fan</i>.]&nbsp; Well, I never did
meet with such goings on before.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; You and I know how
people conduct themselves in London, Miss Clara.&nbsp; We must
not expect to find the same polite ways down here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; Come now,
&rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t so bad as all that with we.&nbsp; There baint
many what has the tongue of mistress yonder.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m quite unused
to such people.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; And yet, Miss Clara,
&rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t as though they were exactly strangers to you
like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; They feel as good as
strangers to me, any way.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Ah, how well I
understand that, Miss.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t very often as we
lay a length of fine silken by the side of unbleached woollen at
my counters.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; I could go through with
it better perhaps, if I didn&rsquo;t feel so terrible faint and
sinking.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Going to the back
kitchen door</i>.]&nbsp; Here, Maggie, stir yourself up a
bit.&nbsp; The lady is near fainting, I do count.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Runs in with a
tray on which is a jug of water and a glass</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
bringing the drink for Aunt, Mr. Jenner.&nbsp; Maggie&rsquo;s
crying ever so badly, and Mother&rsquo;s sent her upstairs to
wash her face and put her hair tidy.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Jessie</span> <i>puts the tray on the
table near to where</i> <span class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>is
sitting</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Miles Hoofer</span>
<i>busies himself in pouring out a glass of water and in handing
it with a great deal of exaggerated deference to</i> <span
class="smcap">Joan</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Drinking</i>.]&nbsp; Such a coarse glass!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Ah, you must let me
send you up one from my place during your stay here.&nbsp; Who
could expect a lady to drink from such a thing as that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Laying aside the
glass</i>.]&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a taste of mould in the water
too.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
fresh.&nbsp; Mother drawed it up from the well, she did.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking
disdainfully round on the room</i>.]&nbsp; Such a strange
room.&nbsp; So very common.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; Nay, you mustn&rsquo;t
judge of the house by this.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you recollect the
parlour yonder, with the stuffed birds and the chiney
cupboard?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking round
again</i>.]&nbsp; Such an old-fashioned place as this I never did
see.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a low sort of room too, no carpet on the
boards nor cloth to the table, nor nothing elegant.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Ah, we find the
mansions in town very different to a country farm house,
don&rsquo;t we Miss?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; I should think we did,
Mister Hooper.&nbsp; Why, look at that great old wooden chair by
the hearth?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t it look un-stylish, upon my word,
with no cushions to it nor nothing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Coming quite
close to</i> <span class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>and looking
straight into her face</i>.]&nbsp; That&rsquo;s great
gran&rsquo;ma&rsquo;s chair, what Dad said you&rsquo;d be best
pleased for to see.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>looks very confused and
begins to fan herself hastily</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; And th&rsquo; old
clock&rsquo;s another thing what Dad did say as you&rsquo;d look
upon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; O the old clock&rsquo;s
well enough, to be sure.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; I did want to gather
a nosegay of flowers to set in your bedroom, Aunt, but Mother,
she said, no.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Languidly</i>.]&nbsp; I must say I don&rsquo;t see any
flowers blooming here that I should particular care about having
in my apartment.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; And Father said as
how you&rsquo;d like to smell the blossoms in the garden.&nbsp;
And Georgie told as how you did use to gather the clover blooms
when you was a little girl and set them by you where you did
sleep.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Crossly</i>.]&nbsp;
O run away, child, I&rsquo;m tired to death with all this
chatter.&nbsp; How would you like to be so pestered after such a
travel over the rough country roads as I have had?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; Now, my little maid,
off you go.&nbsp; Take back the tray to Mother, and be careful as
you don&rsquo;t break the glasses on it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking up the
tray</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;m off to play in the hayfield along of
Robin, then.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Luke</span> <i>opens the back kitchen
door for her and she goes out</i>.&nbsp; <i>Meanwhile</i> <span
class="smcap">Miles</span> <i>has taken up the fan and is
fanning</i> <span class="smcap">Joan</span>, <i>who leans back in
her chair with closed eyes and exhausted look</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Coming to her side
and sitting down</i>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill seem more homelike when
Thomas do come up from the field.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Raising herself and
looking at him</i>.]&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t trouble about me,
Mister Jenner.&nbsp; I shall be quite comfortable presently.</p>
<p>[<i>The back door opens and</i> <span
class="smcap">Maggie</span> <i>comes hurriedly in</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; Please, mistress,
there be a young person a-coming through the rick yard.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Nervously</i>.]&nbsp; A young person?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; Mistress be at the
gooseberries a-gathering of them, and the children be gone off to
th&rsquo; hay field.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis very likely
your serving maid, dear Miss.&nbsp; Shall I fetch the young woman
in to you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; My maid, did you
say?&nbsp; My maid?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; Ah, depend on it,
&rsquo;tis she.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; The young person do
have all the looks of a serving wench, mistress.&nbsp; She be
tramping over the yard with naught but a white handkerchief over
the head of she and a poking into most of the styes and a-calling
of the geese and poultry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s her, right
enough.&nbsp; Bring her in, Mag.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Agitatedly</i>.]&nbsp; No, no&mdash;I mean&mdash;I want to
see her particular&mdash;and alone.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go to meet
her.&nbsp; You&mdash;gentlemen&mdash;[<span
class="smcap">Maggie</span> <i>goes slowly into the back
kitchen</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Placing a chair
for</i> <span class="smcap">Joan</span>.]&nbsp; Delicate ladies
should not venture out into the heat at this time of day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>With sudden
resolution ignoring the chair and going to the window</i>.]&nbsp;
Then, do you two kind gentlemen take a stroll in the
garden.&nbsp; I have need of the services of my&mdash;my young
woman.&nbsp; But when she has put me in order after the dusty
journey, I shall ask you to be good enough to come back and while
away an hour for me in this sad place.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Fervently</i>.]&nbsp; Anything to oblige a lady, miss.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
right.&nbsp; Us&rsquo;ll wait while you do lay aside your
bonnet.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Miles</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Luke</span> <i>go out through the garden
door</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Miles</span>, <i>turning to
bow low before he disappears</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>stands as though distraught in the
middle of the room</i>.&nbsp; <i>Through the open door of the
back kitchen the voices of</i> <span class="smcap">Clara</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Maggie</span> <i>are distinctly
heard</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Is no one at home
then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; Ah, go you straight
on into the kitchen, you&rsquo;ll find whom you be searching for
in there.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d take and shew you in myself only
I&rsquo;m wanted down to th&rsquo; hayfield now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t put
yourself to any trouble about me.&nbsp; I know my way.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>comes into the
kitchen</i>.&nbsp; <i>She has tied a white handkerchief over her
head</i>, <i>and carries a bunch of wildflowers in her
hands</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Still in your cloak
and bonnet!&nbsp; Why, I thought by now you would have unpacked
our things and made yourself at home.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Joining her hands
supplicatingly and coming towards</i> <span
class="smcap">Clara</span>, <i>speaking almost in a
whisper</i>.]&nbsp; O mistress, you&rsquo;ll never guess what
I&rsquo;ve been and done.&nbsp; But &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t all my
fault at the commencement.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking her over
searchingly</i>.]&nbsp; You do look very disturbed, Joan, what
has happened?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas the fine
bonnet and cloak, mam.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas they as did it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Did what?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; Put the thought into my
head, like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; What thought?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; As how &rsquo;twould
feel to be a real grand lady, like you, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; What then, Joan?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; So I began to pretend
all to myself as how that I was one, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Come, tell me all.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; And whilst I was sat
down upon that fallen tree, and sort of pretending to myself, the
two gentlemen came along.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; What gentlemen?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; Gentlemen as was after
courting you, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Courting me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; Yes, and they commenced
speaking so nice and respectful like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Go on, Joan,
don&rsquo;t be afraid.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; It did seem to fall in
with the game I was a-playing with myself.&nbsp; And then, before
I did know how, &rsquo;twas they was both of them a-taking me for
you, mam.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; And did you not
un-deceive them, Joan?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Very
ashamedly</i>.]&nbsp; No, mam.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; You should have told
them the truth about yourself at once.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; O I know I should have,
mistress.&nbsp; But there was something as held me back when I
would have spoke the words.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; I wonder what that
could have been?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas them being
such very nice and kind gentlemen.&nbsp; And, O mistress,
you&rsquo;ll not understand it, because you&rsquo;ve told me many
times as the heart within you have never been touched by
love.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Suddenly sitting
down</i>.]&nbsp; And has yours been touched to-day, Joan, by
love?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; That it have,
mistress.&nbsp; Love have struck at it heavily.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Through which of the
gentlemen did it strike, Joan?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; Through both.&nbsp;
Leastways, &rsquo;tis Mister Jenner that my feelings do go out
most quickly to, mistress.&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis Mister Hooper who
do court the hardest and who has the greatest riches like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Well, and what do you
want me to do or to say now, Joan?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; See here, mistress, I
want you to give me a chance.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll never stoop to
wed me if they knows as I&rsquo;m but a poor serving maid.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Your dressing up as a
fine lady won&rsquo;t make you other than what you are, Joan.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; Once let me get the
fish in my net, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Are you proposing to
catch the two, Joan?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; I shall take the one as
do offer first, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;ll be
Mister Hooper, I should think.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; I should go riding in
my own chaise, mistress, if &rsquo;twas him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; But, Joan, either of
these men would have to know the truth before there could be any
marriage.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; I knows that full well,
mistress.&nbsp; But let one of them just offer hisself.&nbsp; By
that time my heart and his would be so closely twined together
like, &rsquo;twould take more nor such a little thing as my
station being low to part us.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>sits very still for a few
moments</i>, <i>looking straight before her</i>, <i>lost in
thought</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>sinks on to
a chair by the table as though suddenly tired out</i>, <i>and she
begins to cry gently</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Listen, Joan.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m one for the straight paths.&nbsp; I like to walk in
open fields and over the bare heath.&nbsp; Only times come when
one is driven to take to the ways which are set with bushes and
with briars.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Lifting her head
and drying her eyes</i>.]&nbsp; O mistress, I feel to be asking
summat as is too heavy for you to give.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; But for a certain
thing, I could never have lent myself to this acting game of
yours, Joan.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; No, mistress?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Only that, to-day, my
heart too has gone from my own keeping.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; O mistress, you
don&rsquo;t mean to say as his lordship have followed us down
already.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Scornfully</i>.]&nbsp; His lordship!&nbsp; As if I should be
stirred by him!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Humbly</i>.]&nbsp;
Who might it be, mistress, if I may ask?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis one who
would never look upon me with thoughts of love if I went to him
as I am now, Joan.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t rightly
understand you, mam.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; My case is just the
same as yours, Joan.&nbsp; You say that your fine gentlemen would
not look upon a serving maid.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m certain of
it, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; And the man I&mdash;I
love will never let his heart go out to mine with the heaviness
of all these riches lying between us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; I count that gold do
pave the way for most of us, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; So for this once, I
will leave the clear high road, Joan.&nbsp; And you and I will
take a path that is set with thorns.&nbsp; Pray God they do not
wound us past healing at the end of our travel.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; O mistress,
&rsquo;twill be a lightsome journey for me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; But the moment that
you reach happiness, Joan, remember to confess.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; There won&rsquo;t be
nothing to fear then, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Make him love you for
yourself, Joan.&nbsp; O we must each tie the heart of our true
love so tightly to our own that naught shall ever be able to cut
the bonds.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; Yes, mistress, and
I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m very much obliged to you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Ah, I am lending
myself to all this, because I, too, have something to win or
lose.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; Where did you meet him,
mistress?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; I did not meet
him.&nbsp; I stood on the high ground, and he passed below.&nbsp;
His face was raised to the light, and I saw its look.&nbsp; I
think my love for him has always lain asleep in my heart,
Joan.&nbsp; But when he passed beneath me in the meadow, it
awoke.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; O mistress, what sort
of an appearance has the gentleman?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how
to answer you, Joan.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; I count as it would
take a rare, grand looking man for to put his lordship into the
shadow, like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; You are right there,
Joan.&nbsp; But now we must talk of your affairs.&nbsp; Your fine
courtiers will be coming in presently and you must know how to
receive them in a good way.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what do
hamper me dreadful, my speech and other things.&nbsp; How would
it be if you was to help me a little bit, like?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; With all my heart.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; How should I act so not
to be found out, mistress?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; You must speak little,
and low.&nbsp; Do not show haste in your goings and
comings.&nbsp; Put great care into your way of eating and
drinking.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; O that will be a
fearsome hard task.&nbsp; What else?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; You must be sisterly
with Thomas.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d clean forgot
him.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t doubt but what he&rsquo;ll ferret out
the truth in no time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think
so.&nbsp; I was but a little child when I left him.&nbsp; He will
not remember how I looked.&nbsp; And our colouring is alike,
Joan.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the eating
and drinking as do play most heavily upon my mind, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Then think of these
words as you sit at table.&nbsp; Eat as though you were not
hungry and drink as though there were no such thing as
thirst.&nbsp; Let your hands move about your plate as if they
were too tired to lift the knife and fork.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Absently</i>,
<i>raising the knife to her mouth</i>.]&nbsp; How&rsquo;s that,
mistress?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Not so, not so,
Joan.&nbsp; That might betray you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; What, mistress?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the fork
which journeys to the mouth, and the knife stops at home on the
plate.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Dispiritedly</i>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis almost more than I did
reckon for when I started.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Well, we mustn&rsquo;t
think of that now.&nbsp; We must hold up our spirits, you and
I.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Getting up and
putting away the crockery</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;d best take off the
bonnet and the cloak, mistress, hadn&rsquo;t I?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Yes, that you
had.&nbsp; We will go upstairs together and I will help you
change into another gown.&nbsp; Come quickly so that we may have
plenty of time.</p>
<p>[<i>They go towards the staircase door</i>, <span

her hand on the latch of the door she gives one look round the
kitchen</i>.&nbsp; <i>Then with a sudden movement she goes up to
the wooden armchair at the hearth and bends her head till her
lips touch it</i>, <i>she then runs upstairs</i>, <i>followed
by</i> <span class="smcap">Joan</span>.</p>
<h3>ACT II.&mdash;Scene 2.</h3>
<p><i>After a few moments</i> <span class="smcap">Miles
Hooper</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Luke Jenner</span>
<i>come into the kitchen</i>.&nbsp; <i>They both look round the
room enquiringly</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; Ah, she be still up
above with that there serving wench what&rsquo;s come.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; My good man, you
didn&rsquo;t expect our fair miss to have finished her toilet
under an hour, did you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see what
there was to begin on myself, let alone finish.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis clear you
know little of the ways of our town beauties, Luke.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; Still, I mean to have
my try with her, Miles Hooper.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Sarcastically</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;m quite agreeable, Mister
Jenner.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Thomas</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">George</span> <i>come in</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">George</span> <i>carries a bucket of water</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s the
little maid got to?&nbsp; George and me be come up from the field
on purpose for to bid her welcome home.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Miss is still at her
toilet, farmer.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Joan</span>, <i>in a flowered silk
gown</i>, <i>comes slowly and carefully into the room</i>,
<i>followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Clara</span>, <i>who
carries a lace shawl over one arm</i>.&nbsp; <i>She has put on a
large white apron</i>, <i>but wears nothing on her head but the
narrow blue ribbon</i>.&nbsp; <i>During the following scene she
stands quietly</i>, <i>half hidden by the door</i>.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>looks nervously round the
room</i>, <i>then she draws herself up very haughtily</i>.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Miles</span> <i>comes forward and bows
low</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking</i> <span
class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>up and down</i>.]&nbsp; Well, bless
my soul, who&rsquo;d have guessed at the change it do make in a
wench?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Holding out her
hand</i>, <i>very coldly</i>.]&nbsp; A good afternoon to you,
sir.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking her hand
slowly</i>.]&nbsp; Upon my word, but you might knock me over.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Miss has grown into a
very superb young lady, Thomas.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Still looking at
her</i>.]&nbsp; That may be so, yet &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t as such
I had figured she in the eye of my mind, like.&nbsp; [<i>There is
a moment&rsquo;s silence</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; George, my boy, you
and sister Clara used to be up to rare games one with
t&rsquo;other once on a time.&nbsp; [<i>Turning to</i> <span
class="smcap">Joan</span>.]&nbsp; There, my wench, I count
you&rsquo;ve not forgotten Georgie?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afeared
I&rsquo;ve not much of a memory.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Shake hands, my maid,
and very like as the memory will come back to roost same as the
fowls do.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Bowing
coldly</i>.]&nbsp; Good afternoon, George.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Aside to
Luke</i>.]&nbsp; Now that&rsquo;s what I call a bit of stylish
breeding.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">George</span> <i>has made no answer
to</i> <span class="smcap">Joan&rsquo;s</span> <i>bow</i>.&nbsp;
<i>He quietly ignores it</i>, <i>and takes up his pail of
water</i>.&nbsp; <i>As he does so he catches sight of</i> <span
class="smcap">Clara</span>, <i>who has been watching the whole
scene from the corner where she is partly concealed</i>.&nbsp;
<i>He looks at her for one moment</i>, <i>and then sets the
bucket down again</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Why, George&mdash;I
guess as it&rsquo;s took you as it took me, us didn&rsquo;t think
how &rsquo;twould appear when Miss Clara was growed up.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Quietly</i>.]&nbsp; No, us did not, master.</p>
<p>[<i>He carries his pail into the back kitchen as</i> <span
class="smcap">Emily</span> <i>and the children come in</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s all this
to-do in my kitchen, I should like to know?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Us did but come up
for to&mdash;to give a handshake to sister Clara, like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Well, now you can go
off back to work again.&nbsp; And you&mdash;[<i>turning to</i>
<span class="smcap">Joan</span>]&mdash;now that you&rsquo;ve
finished curling of your hair and dressing of yourself up, you
can go and sit down in the best parlour along with your fancy
gentlemen.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Offering his arm
to</i> <span class="smcap">Joan</span>.]&nbsp; It will be my
sweet pleasure to conduct Missy to the parlour.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Luke</span> <i>offers his arm on the
other side</i>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Joan</span>
<i>moves off with both the young men</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>As she
goes</i>.]&nbsp; Indeed, I shall be glad to rest on a comfortable
couch.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m dead tired of the country air already.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Calling after
her</i>.]&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll not go off to sleep afore the
chicken and sparrow grass is ate, will you, Aunt?</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Miles</span>, <span
class="smcap">Luke</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>having gone out</i>, <span
class="smcap">Emily</span> <i>begins to bang the chairs back in
their places and to arrange the room</i>, <i>watched by the two
children</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Clara</span>, <i>who has
remained half hidden by the door</i>, <i>now goes quietly
upstairs</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp;

<p>[<span class="smcap">George</span> <i>comes in</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Well, George,
&rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t much worse nor I expected.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like
Aunt Clara.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; I hates her very
much.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Slowly</i>.]&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t seem to fancy her
neither.</p>

<h3>ACT III.&mdash;Scene 1.</h3>
<p><i>Two days have passed by</i>.</p>
<p><i>It is morning</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Clara</span>,
<i>wearing an apron and a muslin cap on her head</i>, <i>sits by
the kitchen table mending a lace handkerchief</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Maggie</span>, <i>who is dusting the plates on the
dressers</i>, <i>pauses to watch her</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d sooner
sweep the cow sheds out and that I would, nor have to set at such
a niggly piece of sewing work as you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; I cannot do it
quickly, it is so fine.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; I count &rsquo;tis
very nigh as bad as the treadmills, serving a young miss such as
yourn be.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; What makes you say
that, Maggie?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; Missis be very high
in her ways and powerful sharp in the tongue, but I declare as
your young lady will be worser nor missis when she do come to
that age.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Why do you think this,
Mag?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; O she do look at any
one as though they was lower nor the very worms in the
ground.&nbsp; And her speaks as though each word did cost she
more nor a shilling to bring it out.&nbsp; And see how
destructive she be with her fine clothing.&nbsp; A laced
petticoat tore to ribbons last night, and to-day yon
handkerchief.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; These things are soon
mended.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Maggie</span> <i>continues to dust for a
few moments</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; The day you comed
here, &rsquo;twas a bit of ribbon as you did have around of your
hair.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>After a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation</i>.]&nbsp; I put it on to keep my hair
neat on the journeying.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Coming
nearer</i>.]&nbsp; I count as you&rsquo;ve not missed it, have
you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Indeed I have, and I
think I must have lost it in the hayfield.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t
lost.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Where is it then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; Look here, I could
tell you, but I shan&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; If you have found it,
Maggie, you may keep it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould be a
fine thing to be a grand serving maid as you be, and to give away
ribbons, so &rsquo;twould.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>takes no notice of her
and goes on sewing</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>More
insistently</i>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t me as found the
ribbon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Who was it then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; I daresay you&rsquo;d
like for to know, but I&rsquo;m not going to say nothing more
about it.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Maggie</span> <i>leans against the table
watching</i> <span class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>as she
sews</i>.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Emily</span> <i>with both the children
now come in</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Emily</span>
<i>carries a basket of potatoes</i>, <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Jessie</span> <i>a large bowl</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Setting down the
basket</i>.]&nbsp; Maggie, you idle, bad girl, whatever are you
doing here when master expects you down in the meadow to help
with the raking?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; I be just a-going off
yonder, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d thank other
folk not to bring dressed up fine young serving minxes down
here&mdash;you was bad enough afore, Maggie, but you&rsquo;ll be
a hundred times worser now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be off and
help master.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been and put the meat on to boil as
you said, missis.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Maggie</span> <i>goes off</i>.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>continues to sew</i>,
<i>quietly</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Jessie</span> <i>has
put her bowl down on the table</i>, <i>and now comes to her
side</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Robin</span> <i>also comes
close to her</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Emily</span>
<i>flings herself into a chair for a moment and contemptuously
watches them</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t care
much about our new aunt, Joan.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; Dad said as how Aunt
would be sure to bring us sommat good from London town in them
great boxes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; And Aunt has been
here two days and more, and she hasn&rsquo;t brought us
nothing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Your fine aunt have
been too much took up with her fancy gentlemen to think of what
would be suitable behaviour towards you children.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; Will Aunt Clara get
married soon?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis to be hoped
as she will be.&nbsp; Such a set out in the house I have never
seen afore in all my days.&nbsp; Young women as is hale and
hearty having their victuals took up to their rooms and a-lying
in bed till &rsquo;tis noon or later.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis only one
of them as lies in bed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Clara</span>.]&nbsp; Do you think Aunt has got
sommat for us upstairs, Joan?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Rising and putting
down her work</i>.]&nbsp; I know she has, Robin.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let me
catch you speaking to Master Spring as though you and he was of
the same station, young person.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Master Robin, and Miss
Jessie, I will go upstairs and fetch the gifts that your aunt has
brought for you.</p>
<p>[<i>She goes leisurely towards the staircase door</i>,
<i>smiling at the children</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Ah, and you may tell
your young madam that &rsquo;tis high time as she was out of bed
and abroad.&nbsp; Hear that?&nbsp; [<span
class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>goes out</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; I like her.&nbsp; She
speaks so gentle.&nbsp; Not like Aunt.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a stuck up
sort of fine lady herself like.&nbsp; Look at the hands of her,
&rsquo;tis not a day&rsquo;s hard work as they have done in her
life, I&rsquo;ll warrant.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; What will she bring us
from out of the great boxes, do you think?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Sommat what you
don&rsquo;t need, I warrant.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis always so.&nbsp;
When folks take it into their heads to give you aught, &rsquo;tis
very nigh always sommat which you could do better without.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Emily</span> <i>gets up and begins
settling the pots on the fire</i>, <i>and fetching a jug of cold
water from the back kitchen and a knife which she lays on the
table</i>.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>enters carrying some
parcels</i>.&nbsp; <i>She brings them to the table</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Both the children run to her</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Holding out a long
parcel to</i> <span class="smcap">Emily</span> <i>and speaking to
the children</i>.]&nbsp; The first is for your mother,
children.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>With an angry
exclamation</i>.]&nbsp; Now, you mark my words, &rsquo;twill be
sommat as I shall want to fling over the hedge for all the use
&rsquo;twill be.</p>
<p>[<i>She comes near</i>, <i>opens the parcel and perceives it
to be a length of rich black silk</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; My mistress thought it
might be suitable.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Suitable?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll suitable her.&nbsp; When shall my two hands find time
to sew me a gown out of it, I&rsquo;d like to know?&nbsp; And if
&rsquo;twas sewn, when would my limbs find time to sit down
within of it?&nbsp; [<i>Flinging it down on the table</i>.]&nbsp;
Suitable?&nbsp; You can tell your mistress from me as she can
keep her gifts to herself if she can&rsquo;t do better nor
this.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Stroking the
silk</i>.]&nbsp; O Mother, the feel of it be softer nor a
dove&rsquo;s feather.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Feeling it
too</i>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis better nor the new kittens&rsquo;
fur.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Let us see if your
aunt have done more handsomely towards you children.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; I am afraid not.&nbsp;
These coral beads are for Miss Jessie, with her aunt&rsquo;s dear
love.&nbsp; And this book of pictures is for Master Robin.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Seizing the beads
with delight</i>.]&nbsp; I love a string of beads.&nbsp;
[<i>Putting them on</i>.]&nbsp; How do they look on me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Off with them this
moment.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll learn her to give strings of rubbish to
my child.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Beginning to
cry</i>.]&nbsp; O do let me wear it just a little while, just
till dinner, Mother.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Have done with that
noise.&nbsp; Off with it at once, do you hear.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking the
necklace off</i>.]&nbsp; I love the feel of it&mdash;might I keep
it in my hand then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Seizing
it</i>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill be put by with the silk dress.&nbsp;
So there.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not a suitable thing for a little girl
like you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking up from
the pages of his book</i>.]&nbsp; No one shan&rsquo;t take my
book from me.&nbsp; There be pictures of great horses and sheep
and cows in it&mdash;and no one shan&rsquo;t hide it from me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Putting the silk
dress and necklace on another table</i>.]&nbsp; Next time your
aunt wants to throw her money into the gutter I hope as
she&rsquo;ll ask me to come and see her a-doing of it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Coming up to</i>
<span class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>very tearfully</i>.]&nbsp;
And was there naught for Dad in the great box?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Perhaps there may
be.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; And did Aunt Clara
bring naught for Georgie?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; Poor Georgie.&nbsp;
He never has nothing gived him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; And Mother puts the
worst of the bits on his plate at dinner.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Sharply</i>.]&nbsp; Look you here, young woman.&nbsp; Suppose
you was to take and do something useful with that idle pair of
hands as you&rsquo;ve got.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Yes, mistress, I
should like to help you in something.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Us knows what fine
promises lead to.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; But I mean it.&nbsp;
Do let me help a little.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; See them taters?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Yes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Take and peel and wash
them and get them ready against when I wants to cook them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>A little
doubtfully</i>.]&nbsp; Yes&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
try&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Ah, &rsquo;tis just as
I thought.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re one of them who would stir the fire
with a silver spoon rather nor black their hands with the
poker.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Eagerly</i>.]&nbsp; No, no&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t that.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll gladly do them.&nbsp; Come, Miss Jessie, you will shew
me if I do them wrongly, won&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; O yes, I&rsquo;ll
help you because I like you, Joan.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll help too,
when I have finished looking at my book.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Emily</span> <i>goes out</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>sits down by the table and takes up
a potato and the knife and slowly and awkwardly sets to
work</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Jessie</span> <i>stands by
her watching</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t
take no account of Mother when she speaks so sharp.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis only her way.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; Could you come and be
our serving maid when Maggie&rsquo;s sent off?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; O I should be too slow
and awkward at the work, I think.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; Yes, you don&rsquo;t
do them taters very nice.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; That don&rsquo;t
matter, I like you, and you can tell me fine things about other
parts.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; Georgie can tell of
fine things too.&nbsp; See, there he comes with the vegetables
from the garden.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">George</span> <i>comes in with a large
basket of vegetables</i>, <i>which he sets down in the back
kitchen</i>.&nbsp; <i>Then he stands at the door</i>, <i>silently
watching the group near the table</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; Come here, Georgie,
and let Joan hear some of the tales out of what you do sing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; What would mistress
say if she was to catch me at my songs this time of day?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; Mother&rsquo;s gone
upstairs, she won&rsquo;t know nothing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; Come you here, George,
and look at my fine book what Aunt have brought me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Slowly
approaching the table</i>.]&nbsp; That be a brave, fine book of
pictures, Master Robin.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Holding up the
open book</i>.]&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t fancy Aunt Clara much, but I
likes her better nor I did because of this book.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">George&rsquo;s</span> <i>eyes wander from
the book to</i> <span class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>as she bends
over her work</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; Joan doesn&rsquo;t
know how to do them very nicely, does she George!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the first
time you&rsquo;ve been set down to such work, may be,
mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t say
&ldquo;mistress&rdquo; to Joan, you know.&nbsp; Why, Mother would
be ever so angry if she was to hear you.&nbsp; Joan&rsquo;s only
a servant.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking
up</i>.]&nbsp; Like you, George.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Steadily</i>.]&nbsp; What I was saying is&mdash;&rsquo;Tis
the first time as you have been set afore a bowl of taters like
this.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; You are right,
George.&nbsp; It is the first time since&mdash;since I was quite
a little child.&nbsp; And I think I&rsquo;m very clumsy at my
work.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; No one could work
with them laces a-falling down all over their fingers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; You should turn back
your sleeves for kitchen work, Joan, same as Maggie does.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Yes, you should turn
back your sleeves, Miss Joan.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>puts aside the knife and
basket</i>, <i>turns back her sleeves</i>, <i>and then resumes
her work</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">George&rsquo;s</span>
<i>eyes are rivetted on her hands and arms for a
moment</i>.&nbsp; <i>Then he turns as though to go away</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t go away,
Georgie.&nbsp; Come and tell us how you like Aunt Clara now that
she&rsquo;s growed into such a grand lady.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Coming back to
the table</i>.]&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like nothing about her, Miss
Jessie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; Is Aunt very much
changed from when she did use to ride the big horses to the
trough, Georgie?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; And from the time when
th&rsquo; old gander did take a big piece right out of her arm,
Georgie?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; [<i>His eyes on</i>
<span class="smcap">Clara&rsquo;s</span> <i>bent head</i>.]&nbsp;
I count her be wonderful changed, like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; So that you would
scarce know her?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; So that I should
scarce know she.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; She have brought
Mother a silken gown and me a string of coral beads.&nbsp; But
naught for you, Georgie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; I reckon as Miss
Clara have not kept me in her remembrance like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>With sudden
earnestness</i>.]&nbsp; O that she has, George.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t seem
to know him by her looks.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Looks often speak but
poorly for the heart.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Who has been
watching</i> <span class="smcap">Clara</span>.]&nbsp; See there,
Joan.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve been and cut that big tater right in
half.&nbsp; Mother will be cross.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; O dear, I am
thoughtless.&nbsp; One cannot work and talk at the same time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking basket and
knife from her and seating himself on the edge of the
table</i>.]&nbsp; Here,&mdash;give them all to me.&nbsp; I
understand such work, and &rsquo;tis clear that you do not.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll finish them off in a few minutes, and mistress will
never be the wiser.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; O thank you, George,
but am I to go idle?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; You can take up with
that there white sewing if you have a mind.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis more
suited to your hands nor this rough job.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>puts down her sleeves and
takes up her needlework</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; Sing us a song,
George, whilst you do the taters.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; No, Miss
Jessie.&nbsp; My mood is not a singing mood this day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; You ask him,
Joan.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Will not you sing one
little verse, George?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Nay&mdash;strangers
from London town would have no liking for the songs we sing down
here among the fields.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; There was a song I
once heard in the country that pleased me very well.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; What was it
called?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; I cannot remember the
name&mdash;but there was something of bushes and of briars in
it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; I know which that
is.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a pretty song.&nbsp; Sing it, Georgie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Nay&mdash;sing it
yourself, Miss Jessie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis like this
at the beginning.&mdash;[<i>she sings or repeats</i>]&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Through bushes and through briars<br />
I lately took my way,<br />
All for to hear the small birds sing<br />
And the lambs to skip and play.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; That is the song I was
thinking of, Jessie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Can you go on with
it, Miss Jessie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t say any
more.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Gently singing or
speaking</i>.]</p>
<p class="poetry">I overheard my own true love,<br />
Her voice it was so clear.<br />
&ldquo;Long time I have been waiting for<br />
The coming of my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Heaving a
sigh</i>.]&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; Go on, Joan, I do
like the sound of it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Shall I go on with the
song, George?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; As you please.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Sometimes I am uneasy<br />
And troubled in my mind,<br />
Sometimes I think I&rsquo;ll go to my love<br />
And tell to him my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;And if I would go to my love<br />
My love he will say nay<br />
If I show to him my boldness<br />
He&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er love me again.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; When her love was hid
a-hind of the bushes and did hear her a-singing so pitiful, what
did he do then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know,
Jessie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; I reckon as he did
come out to show her as he knowed all what she did keep in her
mind.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Very likely the briars
were so thick between them, Jess, that he never got to the other
side for her to tell him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Yes, that&rsquo;s how
&rsquo;twas, I count.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Running up to</i>
<span class="smcap">Robin</span>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to look
at your book along of you, Robin.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m the one
to turn the leaves, remember.&nbsp; [<i>The children sit side by
side looking at the picture book</i>.&nbsp; <span

into the water</i>, <i>he looks at</i> <span
class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>for the first time</i>.&nbsp; <i>A
long silence</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Miss Clara and me was
good friends once on a time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Tell me how it was
then, George.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; I did used to put her
on the horse&rsquo;s back, and we would go down to the water
trough in the evening time and&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; What else did you and
Miss Clara do together, George?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Us would walk in the
woods aside of one another&mdash;And I would lift she to a high
branch in a tree&mdash;and pretend for to leave her there.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; And then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Her would call upon
me pitiful&mdash;and I would come back from where I was hid.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; And did her crying
cease?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; She would take and
spring as though her was one of they little wild squirrels as do
dance about in the trees.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Where would she spring
to, George?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; I would hold out my
two arms wide to her, and catch she.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; And did she never
fall, whilst springing from the tree, George?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; I never let she fall,
nor get hurted by naught so long as her was in the care of
me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Slowly</i>,
<i>after a short pause</i>.]&nbsp; I do not think she can have
forgotten those days, George.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Getting up and
speaking harshly</i>.]&nbsp; They&rsquo;re best forgot.&nbsp; Put
them away.&nbsp; There be briars and brambles and thorns and
sommat of all which do hurt the flesh of man atween that time and
this&rsquo;n.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>turns her head away and

<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; George, what are you
at sitting at the kitchen table I&rsquo;d like to know?</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">George</span> <i>gets hastily
off</i>.&nbsp; <i>Both children look up from their book</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking freezingly
at</i> <span class="smcap">Clara</span>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis plain
as a turnpike what you&rsquo;ve been after, young person.&nbsp;
If you was my serving wench, &rsquo;tis neck and crop as you
should be thrown from the door.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; What for,
mistress?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; What for?&nbsp; You
have the impudence to ask what for?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll soon tell
you.&nbsp; For making a fool of George and setting your cap at
him and scandalising of my innocent children in their own
kitchen.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; This be going a bit
too far, missis.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not have things said like
that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Then you may turn out
on to the roads where you were took from&mdash;a grizzling little
roadsters varmint.&nbsp; You do cost more&rsquo;n what you eats
nor what we get of work from out of your body, you great
hulk.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Springing up
angrily</i>.]&nbsp; O I&rsquo;ll not hear such things said.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll not.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Who asked you to
speak?&nbsp; Get you upstairs and pull your mistress out of
bed&mdash;and curl the ringlets of her hair and dust the flour on
to her face.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis about all you be fit for.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Angrily going to
the stair door</i>.]&nbsp; Very well.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis best that
I should go.&nbsp; I might say something you would not like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Advancing
towards</i> <span class="smcap">Emily</span>.]&nbsp; Look you
here, mistress.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve put up with it going on for
fifteen years.&nbsp; But sometimes &rsquo;tis almost more nor I
can bear.&nbsp; If &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t for Master Thomas
I&rsquo;d have cleared out this long time ago.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t flatter
yourself as Thomas needs you, my man.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; We has always been
good friends, farmer and me.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not for what I gets
from he nor for what he do get out of I as we do hold
together.&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis this&mdash;as he and I do
understand one another.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll see what
master has to say when I tell him how you was found sitting on
the kitchen table and love-making with that saucy piece of London
trash.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m off.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve no patience to listen any longer.&nbsp; You called me
roadster varmint.&nbsp; Well, let it be so.&nbsp; On the road I
was born and on the road I was picked from my dead mother&rsquo;s
side, and I count as &rsquo;tis on the road as I shall breathe my
last.&nbsp; But for all that, I&rsquo;ll not have road dirt flung
on me by no one.&nbsp; For, roadsters varmint though I be, there
be things which I do hold brighter nor silver and cleaner nor new
opened leaves, and I&rsquo;ll not have defilement throwed upon
them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Seizing the arms
of</i> <span class="smcap">Jessie</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Robin</span>.]&nbsp; The lad&rsquo;s raving.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis plain as he&rsquo;s been getting at the cider.&nbsp;
Come you off with me to the haymaking, Robin and Jess.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; May I take my book
along of me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Flinging the book
down violently</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll book you!&nbsp; What
next?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; Poor Georgie.&nbsp;
He was not courting Joan, mother.&nbsp; He was only doing the
taters for her.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>As they go
out</i>.]&nbsp; The lazy good-for-nothing cat.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll

<p>[<span class="smcap">George</span> <i>is left alone in the

class="smcap">Emily</span> <i>and the children have died
away</i>, <i>he sighs</i>.&nbsp; <i>Then</i>, <i>looking

from his pocket</i>.&nbsp; <i>He spreads it out on one hand and

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Why, George, my

<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Confusedly

Thomas.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking meaningly
at</i> <span class="smcap">George</span>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a
pretty enough young maid, George.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; What did you say,
Master?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; That one with the bit
of blue round the head of her.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Blue?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Ah, George.&nbsp; I
was a young man myself once on a time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Yes, master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t
a piece of blue ribbon as I did find one day, but &rsquo;twas a
blossom dropped from her gown.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Whose gown,
master?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll warrant &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t
missus&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Bless my soul,
no.&nbsp; No, no, George.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t the mistress
then.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Ah, I count as it
could not have been she.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; First love,
&rsquo;tis best, George.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Ah, upon my word,
that &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; But my maid went and
got her married to another.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; More&rsquo;s the
pity, Master Thomas.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Sighing</i>.]&nbsp; Ah, I often thinks of how it might have
been&mdash;with her and me, like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Had that one a soft
tongue to her mouth, master?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Soft and sweet as the
field lark, George.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Then that had been
the one for you to have wed, Master Thomas.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Ah, George,
don&rsquo;t you never run into the trap, no matter whether
&rsquo;tis baited with the choicest thing you ever did dream
on.&nbsp; Once in, never out.&nbsp; There &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; No one would trouble
to set a snare for me, master.&nbsp; I baint worth trapping.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; You be a brave, fine
country lad, George, what a pretty baggage from London town might
give a year of her life to catch, so be it her had the
fortune.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; No, no, Master
Thomas.&nbsp; Nothing of that.&nbsp; There baint nothing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; There be a piece of
blue ribbon, George.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; They be coming down
and into the room now, master.&nbsp; [<i>Steps are heard in the
staircase</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll off to
the meadow then, George.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">George</span> <i>and</i> <span

<p>[<span class="smcap">Joan</span>, <i>dressed as a lady of
fashion</i>, <i>and followed by</i> <span

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Now, Joan, if I were
you, I should go out into the garden, and let the gentlemen find
you in the arbour.&nbsp; Your ways are more easy and natural when
you are in the air.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; O I&rsquo;m very nigh
dead with fright when I&rsquo;m within doors.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis so
hard to move about without knocking myself against sommat.&nbsp;
But at table &rsquo;tis worst of all.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve stopped
up in your room two breakfasts with the headache, and yesterday
we took our dinner to the wood.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; But to-night
&rsquo;twill be something cruel, for Farmer Thomas have asked
them both to supper again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Luke Jenner and the
other man?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; I beg you to practise
me in my ways, a little, afore the time, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; That I will.&nbsp; We
will find out what is to be upon the table, and then I will shew
you how it is to be eaten.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; And other things as
well as eating.&nbsp; When I be sitting in the parlour, Miss
Clara, and Hooper, he comes up and asks my pleasure, what have I
got to say to him?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; O, I shouldn&rsquo;t
trouble about that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d open my fan and take no
notice if I were you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; I do feel so awkward
like in speech with Farmer Thomas, mistress.&nbsp; And with the
children, too.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Come, you must take
heart and throw yourself into the acting.&nbsp; Try to be as a
sister would with Thomas.&nbsp; Be lively, and kind in your way
with the children.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; I tries to be like old
Madam Lovel was, when I talks with them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; That cross, rough mode
of hers sits badly on any one young, Joan.&nbsp; Be more of
yourself, but make little changes in your manner here and
there.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>With a heavy
sigh</i>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the here and the there as I finds it
so hard to manage.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Running in
breathlessly</i>.]&nbsp; A letter, a letter for Aunt Clara.&nbsp;
[<span class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>involuntarily puts out her
hand</i>.]&nbsp; No, Joan.&nbsp; I was to give it to Aunt Clara
herself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve run all the way.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>slowly takes the
letter</i>, <i>looking confused</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; Will you read it now,
Aunt?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; Run away, little girl,
I don&rsquo;t want no children worriting round me now.&nbsp;
[<i>Suddenly recollecting herself and forcing herself to speak
brightly</i>.]&nbsp; I mean&mdash;no, my dear little girl,
I&rsquo;d rather wait to read it till I&rsquo;m by myself; but
thank you very kindly all the same, my pet.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; O, but I should like
to hear the letter read, so much.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; Never mind.&nbsp; Run
along back to mother, there&rsquo;s a sweet little maid.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d sooner stop
with you now, you look so much kinder, like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking</i> <span
class="smcap">Jessie&rsquo;s</span> <i>hand and leading her to
the door</i>.]&nbsp; Now, Miss Jessie, your aunt must read her
letter in quiet, but if you will come back presently I will have
a game with you outside.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>As she runs
off</i>.]&nbsp; Mother won&rsquo;t let me talk with you any more,
alone.&nbsp; She says as you&rsquo;ve made a fool of Georgie and
you&rsquo;ll do the same by us all.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>When</i> <span
class="smcap">Jessie</span> <i>has run off</i>.]&nbsp; There now,
how did I do that, mistress?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Better, much
better.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the feeling
of one thing and the speaking of another, with you ladies and
gentlemen.&nbsp; So it appears to me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>After a
moment&rsquo;s thought</i>.]&nbsp; No.&nbsp; It is not quite like
that.&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis, perhaps, the dressing up of an ugly
feeling in better garments.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Handing the letter
to</i> <span class="smcap">Clara</span>.]&nbsp; There, mistress,
&rsquo;tis yours, not mine.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Glancing at
it</i>.]&nbsp; Lord Lovel&rsquo;s writing.&nbsp; [<span
class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>opens the letter and reads it
through</i>.]&nbsp; He will not wait longer for my answer.&nbsp;
And he is coming here as fast as horses can bring him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; O, mistress, whatever
shall we do?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; We had better own to
everything at once.&nbsp; It will save trouble in the end.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; Own to everything now,
and lose all just as my hand was closing upon it, like!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Poor Joan, it will not
make any difference in the end, if the man loves you truly.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; Be kind and patient
just to the evening, mistress.&nbsp; Hooper is coming up to see
me now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d bring him to offer his self, if I was but
left quiet along of him for a ten minutes or so.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; And then, Joan?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; And then, when was all
fixed up comfortable between us, mistress, maybe as you could
break it gently to him so as he wouldn&rsquo;t think no worse of
me.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>gets up and goes to the
window</i>, <i>where she looks out for a few minutes in
silence</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>cries
softly meanwhile</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Turning
towards</i> <span class="smcap">Joan</span>.]&nbsp; As you will,
Joan.&nbsp; Very likely &rsquo;twill be to-morrow morning before
my lord reaches this place.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; O bless you for your
goodness, mistress.&nbsp; And I do pray as all may go as well
with you as &rsquo;tis with me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Sadly</i>.]&nbsp;
That is not likely, Joan.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; What is it stands in
the way, mistress?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Briars, Joan.&nbsp;
Thorns of pride, and many another sharp and hurting thing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; Then take you my
counsel, mistress, and have his lordship when he do offer
next.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll think of
what you say, Joan.&nbsp; There comes a moment when the heart is
tired of being spurned, and it would fain get into shelter.&nbsp;
[<i>A slight pause</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking through the
window</i>.]&nbsp; Look up quickly, mistress.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
Hooper.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Getting
up</i>.]&nbsp; Then I&rsquo;ll run away.&nbsp; May all be well
with you, dear Joan.&nbsp; [<span class="smcap">Clara</span>
<i>goes out</i>.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>seats herself in a
high-backed chair and opens her fan</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Miles</span> <i>enters</i>, <i>carrying a small
box</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Already astir, Miss
Clara.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis early hours to be sure for one of our
London beauties.</p>
<p>[<i>He advances towards her</i>, <i>and she stretches out her
hand without rising</i>.&nbsp; <i>He takes it
ceremoniously</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; You may sit down, if
you like, Mister Hooper.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Miles</span> <i>places a chair in front
of</i> <span class="smcap">Joan</span>, <i>and sits down on
it</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Untying the
parcel</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been so bold as to bring you a
little keepsake from my place in town, Missy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; How kind you are,
Mister Miles.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be able
to fancy yourself in Bond Street when you see it, Miss Clara.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; Now, you do excite me,
Mister Hooper.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Opening the box
and taking out a handsome spray of bright artificial
flowers</i>.]&nbsp; There, what do you say to that, Miss?&nbsp;
And we can do you the same in all the leading tints.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; O, &rsquo;tis wonderful
modish.&nbsp; I declare I never did see anything to beat it up in
town.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Now I thought as
much.&nbsp; I flatter myself that we can hold our own with the
best of them in Painswick High Street.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; I seem to smell the
very scent of the blossoms, Mister Hooper.</p>
<p>[<i>She puts out her hand shyly and takes the spray from</i>
<span class="smcap">Miles</span>, <i>pretending to smell
it</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Well&mdash;and
what&rsquo;s the next pleasure, Madam?</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>drops the spray and begins
to fan herself violently</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Very
gently</i>.]&nbsp; What&rsquo;s Missy&rsquo;s next pleasure?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I
don&rsquo;t know, Mr. Miles.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Miles Hooper would
like Missy to ask for all that is his.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; O, Mister Hooper, how
kind you are.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Ladies never like the
sound of business, so we&rsquo;ll set that aside for a moment and
discuss the music of the heart in place of it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; Ah, that&rsquo;s a
thing I do well understand, Mister Hooper.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; I loved you from the
first, Miss.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s the true, high born lady for
you, says I to myself.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s beauty and style,
elegance and refinement.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; Now, did you really
think all that, Mister Hooper?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Do not keep me in
suspense, Miss Clara.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; What about, sir?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; The answer to my
question, Missy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; And what was that, I
wonder?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; I want my pretty Miss
to take the name of Hooper.&nbsp; Will she oblige her Miles?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; O that I will.&nbsp;
With all my heart.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Standing
up</i>.]&nbsp; I would not spoil this moment, but by and bye my
sweet Missy shall tell me all the particulars of her income, and
such trifles.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Agitatedly</i>.]&nbsp; O let us not destroy to-day by
thoughts of anything but our dear affection one for
t&rsquo;other.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Why, my pretty town
Miss is already becoming countrified in her speech.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis from hearing
all the family.&nbsp; But, dear Miles, promise there shan&rsquo;t
be nothing but&mdash;but love talk between you and me this
day.&nbsp; I could not bear it if we was to speak of, of other
things, like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Getting up and
walking about the room</i>.]&nbsp; As you will&mdash;as you
will.&nbsp; Anything to oblige a lady.</p>
<p>[<i>He stops before the table</i>, <i>on which is laid</i>
<span class="smcap">Emily&rsquo;s</span> <i>silk dress</i>,
<i>and begins to finger it</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that
you&rsquo;re looking at?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Ten or fifteen
shillings the yard, and not a penny under, I&rsquo;ll be
bound.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; O do come and talk to
me again and leave off messing with the old silk.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; No, no, Missy,
I&rsquo;m a man of business habits, and &rsquo;tis my duty to go
straight off to the meadow and seek out brother Thomas.&nbsp; He
and I have got to talk things over a bit, you know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; Off so soon!&nbsp; O
you have saddened me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Nay, what is it to
lose a few minutes of sweet company, when life is in front of us,
Miss Clara?</p>
<p>[<i>He raises her hand</i>, <i>kisses it</i>, <i>and leaves
her</i>.&nbsp; <i>As he goes out by the door</i> <span
class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>enters</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; O, Mistress&mdash;stop
him going down to Farmer Thomas at the meadow!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Why, Joan, what has
happened?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; All has happened.&nbsp;
But stop him going to the farmer to talk about the&mdash;the
wedding and the money.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; The money?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; The income which he
thinks I have.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll run, but
all this time I&rsquo;ve been keeping Master Luke Jenner quiet in
the parlour.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; O what does he want
now?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Much the same as the
other one wanted.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; Must I see him?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Yes, indeed he will
wait no longer for his answer.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s at boiling point
already.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; Then send him in.&nbsp;
But do you run quickly, Miss Clara, and keep Miles Hooper from
the farmer.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll run my
best, never fear.&nbsp; [<i>She goes out</i>.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Luke Jenner</span> <i>comes in</i>, <i>a
bunch of homely flowers in his hand</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Seating
herself</i>.]&nbsp; You are early this morning, Mister
Jenner.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Sitting opposite to
her</i>.]&nbsp; I have that to say which would not bide till
sunset, Miss Clara.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; Indeed, Mister
Jenner.&nbsp; I wonder what that can be.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis just like
this, Miss Clara.&nbsp; The day I first heard as you was coming
down here&mdash;&ldquo;I could do with a rich wife if so be as I
could win her,&rdquo; I did tell myself.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; O, Mister Jenner, now
did you really?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; But when I met you in
the wood&mdash;saw you sitting there, so still and yet so bright,
so fine and yet so homely.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the maid for
me,&rdquo; I says to myself.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Tearfully</i>.]&nbsp; O, Mister Jenner!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; And if it had been
beggar&rsquo;s rags upon her in the place of satin, I&rsquo;d
have said the same.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Very much
stirred</i>.]&nbsp; O, Mister Jenner, and did you really think
like that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; If all the gold that do
lie atween me and you was sunk in the deep ocean, &rsquo;twould
be the best as could happen.&nbsp; There!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Faintly</i>.]&nbsp;
O, Mister Jenner, why?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; Because, very like
&rsquo;twould shew to you as &rsquo;tis yourself I&rsquo;m after
and not the fortune what you&rsquo;ve got.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; Mister Jenner,
I&rsquo;m mighty sorry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t say
I&rsquo;m come too late, Miss Clara.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; You are.&nbsp; Mister
Hooper was before you.&nbsp; And now, &rsquo;tis he and I who are
like to be wed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; I might have known I
had no chance.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Rising and trying
to hide her emotion</i>.]&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t have had it
happen so for the world, Mr. Jenner.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Laying his bunch of
flowers on the table</i>, <i>his head bent</i>, <i>and his eyes
on the ground</i>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas none of your doing, Miss
Clara.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve naught to blame yourself for.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis not your fault as you&rsquo;re made so&mdash;so
beautiful, and yet so homely.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>looks at him irresolutely
for a moment and then precipitately leaves the room</i>.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Luke</span> <i>folds his arms on the
table and rests his head on them in an attitude of deepest
despondency</i>.&nbsp; <i>After a few moments</i> <span
class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>enters</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; O, Mister Jenner, what
has happened to you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Raising his head
and pointing to the window</i>.]&nbsp; There she goes, through
the garden with her lover.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; I wish that you were
in his place.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Bitterly</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve no house with golden rails to
offer her.&nbsp; Nor any horse and chaise.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; But you carry a heart
within you that is full of true love.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; What use is the love
which be fastened up in a man&rsquo;s heart and can spend itself
on naught, I&rsquo;d like to know.&nbsp; [<i>He rises as though
to go and take up the bunch of flowers which has been lying on
the table</i>.&nbsp; <i>Brokenly</i>.]&nbsp; I brought them for
her.&nbsp; But I count as he&rsquo;ll have given her something
better nor these.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>takes the flowers gently
from his hand</i>, <i>and as she does so</i>, <span
class="smcap">Emily</span> <i>enters</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; What now if you
please!&nbsp; First with George and then with Luke.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twould be Thomas next if he wasn&rsquo;t an old sheep of a
man as wouldn&rsquo;t know if an eye was cast on him or no.&nbsp;
But I&rsquo;ll soon put a stop to all this.&nbsp; Shame on you,
Luke Jenner.&nbsp; And you, you fine piece of London vanity, I
wants my kitchen to myself, do you hear, so off with you
upstairs.</p>
<p>[<i>She begins to move violently about the kitchen as the
curtain falls</i>.</p>
<h3>ACT IV.&mdash;Scene 1.</h3>
<p><i>The kitchen is decorated with bunches of flowers</i>.&nbsp;
<i>A long table is spread with silver</i>, <i>china and
food</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>is setting
mugs to each place</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Maggie</span>
<i>comes in from the back kitchen with a large dish of
salad</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; When folks do come
down to the countryside they likes to enjoy themselves among the
vegetables.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Placing the last
mug</i>.]&nbsp; There&mdash;Now all is ready for them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Bending over a
place at the end of the table</i>.]&nbsp; Come you and look at
this great old bumble-dore, Joan, what have flyed in through the
window.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Goes to</i> <span
class="smcap">Maggie&rsquo;s</span> <i>side and bends down over
the table</i>.]&nbsp; O what a beautiful thing.&nbsp; Look at the
gold on him, and his legs are like feathers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking the bee
carefully up in a duster and letting it fly through the
window</i>.]&nbsp; The sign of a stranger, so they do say.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; A stranger,
Maggie?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; You mind my words,
&rsquo;tis a stranger as&rsquo;ll sit where yon was stuck, afore
the eating be finished.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe
in such signs, myself.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; I never knowed it not
come true.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Thomas</span> <i>comes in</i>.&nbsp;
<i>He is wearing his best clothes and looks pleased</i>, <i>yet
nervous</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Well, maids.&nbsp;
Upon my word &rsquo;tis a spread.&nbsp; Never saw so many
different vituals brought together all at a time afore in this
house.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis in honour
of Miss Clara&rsquo;s going to be married like, master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; So &rsquo;tis, so
&rsquo;tis.&nbsp; Well&mdash;A single rose upon the bush.&nbsp;
Bound to be plucked, you know.&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t be left to
fade in the sun, eh, girls?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Where shall Maggie and
me stop whilst the supper is going on, master?&nbsp; Mistress has
not told us yet.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Nervously</i>.]&nbsp; Mistress haven&rsquo;t told
you&mdash;haven&rsquo;t she?&nbsp; Well&mdash;well&mdash;at such
a time we must all&mdash;all rejoice one with t&rsquo;other,
like.&nbsp; No difference made t&rsquo;wixt master and man.&nbsp;
Nor t&rsquo;wixt maid and missus.&nbsp; Down at the far end of
the table you can sit yourselves, my wenches.&nbsp; Up against
George&mdash;How&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; That will do very well
for us, Master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t expect
as missus will let we bide there long.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Look here, my wench,
I be master in my own house, and at the asking in marriage of my
only sister like, &rsquo;tis me as shall say what shall sit down
with who.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s an end of it.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>.&nbsp; I hear them a coming
in, master.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Emily</span>, <i>holding the hands of</i>
<span class="smcap">Jessie</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Robin</span>, <i>comes into the room</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Her eyes fall on</i> <span class="smcap">Thomas</span> <i>who
is standing between</i> <span class="smcap">Clara</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Maggie</span>, <i>looking suddenly
sheepish and nervous</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>In a voice of
suppressed anger</i>.]&nbsp; Thomas! O, if I catch any more of
these goings on in my kitchen.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Joan</span>, <i>very elegantly dressed
and hanging on the arm of</i> <span class="smcap">Miles
Hooper</span>, <i>follows</i> <span class="smcap">Emily</span>
<i>into the room</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not have
the food kept back any longer for Luke Jenner.&nbsp; If folk
can&rsquo;t come to the time when they&rsquo;re asked, they baint
worth waiting for, so sit you down, all of you.</p>
<p>[<i>She sits down at the head of the table</i>, <i>a child on
either side of her</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Joan</span>

a dish</i>.]&nbsp; You need not think you&rsquo;re to be helped
first, Clara, for all that the party is given for you,

time for their supper, first because you was such a while a
having your head curled and puffed out, and then &rsquo;twas Luke
Jenner as didn&rsquo;t come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Perceiving</i>
<span class="smcap">Clara&rsquo;s</span> <i>movement</i>.]&nbsp;
Well, I never did see anything so forward.&nbsp; Who told you to
sit yourself down along of your betters, if you please, madam
serving maid?</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">George</span> <i>comes involuntarily
forward and stands behind</i> <span
class="smcap">Clara&rsquo;s</span> <i>chair</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>does not move</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Get you out of that
there place this instant, do you hear? [<i>Turning to</i> <span
class="smcap">Miles</span>.]&nbsp; To see the way the young
person acts one might think as she fancied herself as something
uncommon rare and high.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;ll not take any fool
in, not you, for all that you like to play the fine lady.&nbsp;
Us can see through your game very clear, can&rsquo;t us, Mr.
Hooper?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; O certainly, to be
sure, Missis Spring.&nbsp; No one who has the privilege of being
acquainted with a real lady of quality could be mistook by any of
the games played by this young person.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>looks him gravely in the

<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Get up, do you hear,
and help Maggie pass the dishes!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Nervously</i>.]&nbsp; Nay, nay, &rsquo;twas my doing,
Emily.&nbsp; I did tell the wenches as they might sit
their-selves along of we, just for th&rsquo; occasion like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; And who are you, if
you please, giving orders and muddling about like a lord in my
kitchen?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Faintly</i>.]&nbsp; Come, Emily, I&rsquo;m the master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; And I, the
mistress.&nbsp; Hear that, you piece of London impudence?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Comes
forward</i>.]&nbsp; Master Luke be coming up the garden,
mistress.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Luke Jenner</span> <i>enters</i>.&nbsp;

<i>and holds out his hand to her</i>, <i>and then to</i> <span

<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; I do wish you happiness
with all my heart, Miss Clara.&nbsp; Miles, my lad, &rsquo;tis
rare&mdash;rare pleased as I be to shake your hand this day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Come, come, Luke
Jenner, you&rsquo;ve been and kept us waiting more nor half an
hour.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you sit yourself down and give other folk
a chance of eating their victuals quiet?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
naught to make all this giddle-gaddle about as I can see.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Sitting down in the
empty place by</i> <span class="smcap">Joan&rsquo;s</span>
<i>side</i>.]&nbsp; Beg pardon, mistress, I know I&rsquo;m a bit
late.&nbsp; But the victuals as are waited for do have a better
flavour to them nor those which be ate straight from the pot
like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s true
&rsquo;tis.&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis hunger as do make the best
sauce.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">George</span> <i>and</i> <span

side of</i> <span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Emily</span> <i>is too busy dispensing the food to

class="smcap">Clara</span>, <i>and silently cares for her comfort

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Well, Emily; well,
Luke.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t think to lose my little sister afore
she&rsquo;d stopped a three days in the place.&nbsp; That I did
not.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t grudge her to a fine prospering
young man like friend Hooper, no, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; No one called upon you
for a speech, Thomas.&nbsp; See if you can&rsquo;t make yourself
of some use in passing the green stuff.&nbsp; [<i>Turning to</i>
<span class="smcap">Luke</span>.]&nbsp; We have two serving maids
and a man, Mister Jenner, but they&rsquo;re to be allowed to act
the quality to-day, so we&rsquo;ve got to wait upon
ourselves.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; A man is never so well
served as by his own two hands, mistress.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my
saying at home.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; And a good one too,
Luke, my boy, for most folk, but with me &rsquo;tis
otherwise.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got another pair of hands in the
place as do for me as well, nor better than my own.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Yes, Thomas, I often
wonders where you&rsquo;d be without mine.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t
thinking of yourn, Emily.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis George&rsquo;s hands
as I was speaking of.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Contemptuously</i>.]&nbsp; George!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll all
find out your mistake one day, Thomas.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Joan</span>, <i>who has been nervously handling her
knife and fork and watching</i> <span
class="smcap">Clara&rsquo;s</span> <i>movements
furtively</i>.]&nbsp; My sweet Miss is not shewing any
appetite.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m not used to country fare.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; O, I hear you,
Clara.&nbsp; Thomas, this is very fine.&nbsp; Clara can&rsquo;t
feed &rsquo;cause she&rsquo;s not used to country fare!&nbsp;
What next, I&rsquo;d like to know!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Who has been
watching</i> <span class="smcap">Joan</span>.]&nbsp; Why does
Aunt sometimes put her knife in her mouth, Mother?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; My good boy,
&rsquo;tis plain you&rsquo;ve never mixed among the quality or
you would know that each London season has its own new fashion of
acting.&nbsp; This summer &rsquo;tis the stylish thing to put on
a countryfied mode at table.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; Joan don&rsquo;t eat
like that, Mister Hooper.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Joan&rsquo;s only a
maid servant, Miss Jessie.&nbsp; You should learn to distinguish
between such people and fine ladles like your aunt.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Forcing herself to
be more animated</i>.]&nbsp; Give me some fruit, Miles&mdash;I
have no appetite to-day for heavy food.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis far too
warm.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; As for me, the only
food I require is the sweet honey of my Missy&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Ah, &rsquo;tis a
grand thing to be a young man, Miles Hooper.&nbsp; There was a
day when such things did come handy to my tongue, like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Sharply</i>.]&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t seem to remember that day,
Thomas.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Sheepishly</i>,
<i>his look falling</i>.]&nbsp; Ah&mdash;&rsquo;twas
afore&mdash;afore our courting time, Emily.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Energetically</i>.]&nbsp; Prime weather for the hay,
farmer.&nbsp; I count as this dry will last until the whole of it
be carried.&nbsp; [<i>A knock is heard at the door</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Now who&rsquo;ll that
be?&nbsp; Did you see anyone a-coming up the path, Mother?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Do you expect me to be
carving of the fowls and a-looking out of the window the same
time, Thomas?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; George, my lad, do
you open the door and see who &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>looks anxiously across the
table at</i> <span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; <i>Then she
drops her spoon and fork and takes up her fan</i>, <i>using it
violently whilst</i> <span class="smcap">George</span> <i>slowly
gets up and opens the door</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Lord
Lovel</span> <i>is seen standing on the threshold</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Lovel</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">George</span>.]&nbsp; Kindly tell me, my man, is
this the farm they call Ox Lease?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Ah, that&rsquo;s
right enough.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Lovel</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry
to break in upon a party like this, but I want to see Miss Clara
Spring if she is here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Standing
up</i>.]&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve come at the very moment,
master.&nbsp; This be a giving in marriage supper.&nbsp; And
&rsquo;tis Miss Clara, what&rsquo;s only sister to me, as is to
be wed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Lovel</span>.&nbsp; Impossible, my
good sir!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Ah, that&rsquo;s
it.&nbsp; Miles Hooper, he&rsquo;s the happy man.&nbsp; If you be
come by Painswick High Street you&rsquo;ll have seen his name up
over the shop door.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Lovel</span>.&nbsp; Miss
Clara&mdash;Miles Hooper&mdash;No, I can&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Pointing
towards</i> <span class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Miles</span>.]&nbsp; There they be&mdash;the both
of them.&nbsp; Turtle doves on the same branch.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re right welcome, master, to sit down along of we as
one of the family on this occasion.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Lovel</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking
at</i> <span class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>who has suddenly
dropped her fan and is leaning back with a look of supplication
towards</i> <span class="smcap">Clara</span>.]&nbsp; I must have
come to the wrong place&mdash;that&rsquo;s not the Miss Clara
Spring I know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Bending over</i>
<span class="smcap">Joan</span>.]&nbsp; My sweet Missy has no
acquaintance with this gentleman, I am sure.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Lord Lovel</span> <i>suddenly turns round
and perceives</i> <span class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>seated
by</i> <span class="smcap">Maggie</span> <i>at the
table</i>.&nbsp; <i>He quickly goes towards her</i>, <i>holding
out his hand</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Lovel</span>.&nbsp; Miss Clara.&nbsp;
Tell me what is going on.&nbsp; [<i>Looking at her cap and
apron</i>.]&nbsp; Why have you dressed yourself like this?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Come, come.&nbsp;
There seems to be some sort of a hitch here.&nbsp; The young
gentleman has very likely stopped a bit too long at the Spotted
Cow on his way up.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Very faintly</i>,
<i>looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Clara</span>.]&nbsp; O do
you stand by me now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Lays her hand
on</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Lovel&rsquo;s</span>
<i>arm</i>.]&nbsp; Come with me, my lord.&nbsp; I think I can
explain everything if you will only step outside with me.&nbsp;
Come&mdash;[<i>She leads him swiftly through the door which</i>
<span class="smcap">George</span> <i>shuts behind them</i>.]</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>leans back in her chair as
though she were going to faint</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Well, now&mdash;but
that&rsquo;s a smartish wench, getting him out so quiet,
like.&nbsp; George, you&rsquo;d best step after them to see as
the young man don&rsquo;t annoy her in any way.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; That young person can
take good care of herself.&nbsp; Sit you down, Thomas and George,
and get on with your eating, if you can.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; Why did he think Joan
was our aunt, mother?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Cause he was in
that state when a man don&rsquo;t know his right leg from his
left arm.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Who has remained
standing</i>.]&nbsp; Look you here, Master Thomas&mdash;see here
mistress.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis time as there was an end of this
cursed play acting, or whatever &rsquo;tis called.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Play acting there
never has been in my house, George, I&rsquo;d like for you to
know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; O yes there have
been, mistress.&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis time it was finished.&nbsp;
[<i>Pointing to</i> <span class="smcap">Joan</span>.]&nbsp; You
just take and ask that young person what she do mean by tricking
herself out in Miss Clara&rsquo;s gowns and what not, and by
having herself called by Miss Clara&rsquo;s own name.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking</i> <span
class="smcap">Joan&rsquo;s</span> <i>hand in his</i>.]&nbsp; My
sweet Miss must pay no attention to the common fellow.&nbsp; I
dare him to speak like that of my little lady bride.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; A jay bird in
peacock&rsquo;s feathers, that&rsquo;s what &rsquo;tis.&nbsp; And
she&rsquo;s took you all in, the every one of you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; O George, isn&rsquo;t
she really our aunt from London?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; No, that she baint,
Miss Jessie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Come, come, my
lad.&nbsp; I never knew you act so afore.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis clear where
he have spent his time this afternoon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; Nay, nay, I never did
see George inside of the Spotted Cow in all the years I&rsquo;ve
known of him.&nbsp; George baint made to that shape.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; Then who is Aunt
Clara, George?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; She who be just gone
from out of the room, Master Robin, and none other.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Come, George, this
talk do sound so foolish.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t help
that, master.&nbsp; Foolish deeds do call for foolish words, may
be.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; My pretty Miss is
almost fainting, I declare.&nbsp; [<i>He pours out water for</i>
<span class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>and bends affectionately over
her</i>.]&nbsp; Put the drunken fellow outside and let&rsquo;s
have an end of this.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Advancing</i>.]&nbsp; Yes, us&rsquo;ll have an end to it very
shortly.&nbsp; But I be going to put a straight question to the
maid first, and &rsquo;tis a straight answer as her&rsquo;ll have
to give me in reply.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Not a word, not a
word.&nbsp; Miss is sadly upset by your rude manners.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Do you ask of the
young lady but one thing, Master Hooper, and then I&rsquo;ll go
when you will.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; Well, my man,
what&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Do you get her to
speak the name as was given she at baptism, Mister Hooper.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; This is madness.&nbsp;
My pretty Miss shall not be teased by such a question.&nbsp;
Thomas, you&rsquo;ll have to get this stupid fellow locked up, or
something.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Angrily</i>.]&nbsp; Her shall say it, if I stands here all
night.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>suddenly bends forward and
hides her face in her hands</i>, <i>her form shaken by violent
weeping</i>.&nbsp; <i>The door opens and</i> <span
class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>enters followed by</i> <span
class="smcap">Lord Lovel</span>.&nbsp; <i>She has taken off her
cap and apron</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Raising her head
and stretching out her hands to</i> <span
class="smcap">Clara</span>.]&nbsp; O speak for me,
mistress.&nbsp; Speak for me and help.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; I am Clara, she is
Joan.&nbsp; Thomas, Emily, I pray you to forgive us both for
taking you in like this.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Well, I never did
hear tell of such a thing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not going to
believe a word the young person says.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Lovel</span>.&nbsp; She has told you
but the truth, my good friends.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; And who are you, to
put your tongue into the basin, I&rsquo;d like to know?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; This is the nephew of
my dear godmother.&nbsp; Lord Lovel is his name.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; If you think I&rsquo;m
going to be took in with such nonsense, the more fool you, I
says.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Lovel</span>.&nbsp; But all that Miss
Clara tells you is true, Missis Spring.&nbsp; She and her serving
maid, for certain reasons of their own, agreed to change parts
for a few days.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Turning to</i>
<span class="smcap">Joan</span>.]&nbsp; Is this really so, my
maid?</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>bows her head</i>, <i>her
handkerchief still covering her face</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Clara</span>.]&nbsp; Who ever would have thought on
such a thing?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas a foolish
enough thing, but no harm is done.&nbsp; Look up, Joan, and do
not cry so pitifully.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking up at</i>
<span class="smcap">Miles</span>.]&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll never go
and change towards me now that we&rsquo;re most as good as wed,
will you, Mister Hooper?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Rising and
speaking with cold deliberation</i>.]&nbsp; Ladies and gentlemen,
I have the honour to wish you all a very pleasant evening.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Come, come Miles, we
be all a bit turned in the head, it seems.&nbsp; But
things&rsquo;ll settle back to their right places if you gives
them a chance.&nbsp; Sit you down and take a drink of sommat.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be so
foolish, Thomas.&nbsp; As if a man what&rsquo;s been stung by a
wasp would care to sit himself down on a hornet&rsquo;s nest.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; You are perfectly
right, madam.&nbsp; This is no place for me.&nbsp; I have been
sported with.&nbsp; My good name has been treated as a jest.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; O Mister Hooper,
&rsquo;twas my doing, all of it, but I did it for the best, I
did.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Going to the
door</i>.]&nbsp; Thank you, my good woman.&nbsp; Next time you
want to play a little prank like this, I beg that you will select
your partner with more care.&nbsp; The name of Hooper is not a
suitable one to toy with, let me tell you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; Aren&rsquo;t you going
to marry her then, Mister Hooper?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miles</span>.&nbsp; I am not, Master
Robin.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; You said as you could
tell a real lady by her ways, but you couldn&rsquo;t very well,
could he, Mother?</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Miles</span>, <i>covering his
mortification with sarcastic bows made to the right and left</i>,
<i>goes out</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Joan</span> <i>leans
back almost fainting in her chair</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking her
hand</i>.]&nbsp; This is the finest hearing in all the world for
me, Miss&mdash;Miss Joan.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; O Mr. Jenner, how deep
you must despise me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; And that I&rsquo;d
never do, though I&rsquo;m blest if I know why you did it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; It was as much my
fault as hers, Mister Jenner.&nbsp; There were things that each
of us wanted, and that we thought we might get, by changing
places, one with the other.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Clara</span>.]&nbsp; Well, my maid, I&rsquo;m
blessed if I do know what you was a hunting about for, dressed up
as a serving wench.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Turning a little
towards</i> <span class="smcap">George</span>.]&nbsp; I thought
to find something which was mine when I was a little child, but
which I lost.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; O Georgie do know how
to find things which is lost.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas he as brought
back the yellow pullet when her had strayed off.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; And
&rsquo;twas George as did find your blue hair ribbon Aunt Clara,
when it was dropped in the hayfield.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; I believe as Georgie
knowed which of them was our aunt all the time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; I believe it too.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Why, George, you sly
dog, what put you on the scent, like?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas not one,
but many things.&nbsp; And if you wants a clear proof [<i>Turning
to</i> <span class="smcap">Clara</span>]&mdash;put back the laces
of your sleeve, Miss Clara.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; What for, George?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Whilst you was
a-doing of the taters, this morning, you did pull up your
sleeves.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas then I held the proof.&nbsp; Not that
&rsquo;twas needed for me, like.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>pushes up both her
sleeves</i>, <i>and holds out her arms towards</i> <span
class="smcap">George</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Pointing to the
scar</i>.]&nbsp; There &rsquo;tis&mdash;there&rsquo;s where
th&rsquo; old gander have left his mark.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Children</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Getting
up</i>.]&nbsp; Where, where!&nbsp; O do let us see!</p>
<p>[<i>They run round to where</i> <span
class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>stands and look eagerly at the mark
on her arm which she shews to them</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; George, my lad, you
baint th&rsquo; only one as can play fox.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you be so
set up as to think as you can, Thomas.&nbsp; For a more foolish
figure of a goose never was cut.&nbsp; A man might tell when
&rsquo;twas his own sister, if so be as he had his full senses
upon him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; Never you mind,
Emily.&nbsp; What I says to George is, he baint th&rsquo; only
fox.&nbsp; How now, my lad?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see
what you be driving at, master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Slyly</i>.]&nbsp;
What about that bit of blue ribbon, George?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Yes, Thomas.&nbsp; Ask
Georgie if he will give it back to me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Stepping forward
till he is by</i> <span class="smcap">Clara&rsquo;s</span>
<i>side</i>.]&nbsp; No, and that I will not do.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
little enough as I holds, but what little, I&rsquo;ll keep
it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">George</span>.]&nbsp; Those words are like a frail
bridge on which I can stand for a moment.&nbsp; Georgie, do you
remember the days when you used to lead me by the hand into the
deep parts of the wood, lifting me over the briars and the
brambles so that I should not be hurt by their thorns?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Hark you here,
Clara.&nbsp; This once I&rsquo;ll speak.&nbsp; I never had but
one true love, and that was a little maid what would run through
the woods and over all the meadows, her hand in mine.&nbsp; I
learnt she the note of every bird.&nbsp; And when th&rsquo;
evening was come, us would watch together till th&rsquo; old
mother badger did get from out of her hole, and start hunting in
the long grasses.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking</i> <span
class="smcap">George&rsquo;s</span> <i>hand</i>.]&nbsp; Then,
Georgie, there was no need for the disguise that I put upon
myself.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Do you think as the
moon can hide her light when there baint no cloud upon the sky,
Clara?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span>.&nbsp; Georgie, I went in
fear of what this gold and silver might raise up between you and
me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all
finished and done with now, my maid.&nbsp; If I&rsquo;d a hundred
sisters, George should have the pick of them, he should.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;
Thomas.&nbsp; One of your sisters is about enough.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Luke</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Who has been
sitting with</i> <span class="smcap">Joan&rsquo;s</span> <i>hand
in his</i>.]&nbsp; Hark you here, mistress.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
many a cloudy morning turns out a sunshiny day.&nbsp; Baint that
a true saying, Joan?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Joan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking up
radiantly</i>.]&nbsp; O that it is, dear Luke.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Lovel</span>.&nbsp; Miss Clara, it
seems that there is nothing more to be said.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s the
most sensible thing as has been spoke this long while.&nbsp;
Thomas, your sister favours you in being a poor, grizzling sort
of a muddler.&nbsp; She might have took up with this young man,
who has a very respectable appearance.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Lovel</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Coming
forward to</i> <span class="smcap">George</span> <i>and shaking
his hand</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;m proud to make your acquaintance,
sir.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Rising
angrily</i>.]&nbsp; Come Thomas, come Luke, come Clara.&nbsp; Us
might be a barn full of broody hens the way we be set around of
this here table.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill be midnight afore the things
is cleared away and washed up.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.&nbsp; What if it be,
Emily.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t very often as I gets the chance
of minding how &rsquo;twas in times gone past.&nbsp; Ah, I was a
young man in those days, too, I was.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Emily</span>.&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis a rare
old addle head as you be got now, Thomas.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jessie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Slipping her hand
into</i> <span class="smcap">Thomas&rsquo;s</span>.]&nbsp; O do
let us sit up till midnight, Dad.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>.&nbsp; I shall eat a smartish
lot more if we does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; No,
William.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m got to be an old woman now, and
&rsquo;tis time that I had someone at my side to help in the
house-keeping and to share the work.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s Susan
for, if &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t to do that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; Susan?&nbsp; As
idle a piece of goods as ever was seen on a summer&rsquo;s
day!&nbsp; No.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t a serving maid that I
was thinking of, but someone who should be of more account in the
house.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a daughter that I&rsquo;m wanting,
William, and I&rsquo;ve picked out the one who is to my
taste.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Then you&rsquo;ve
done more than I have, Mother.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the
young person whom Luther Smith has left his farm and all his
money to.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got my eye on her for you,
William.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Then you&rsquo;ll
please to put your eye somewhere else, Mother, for I&rsquo;ve
seen them, and they don&rsquo;t suit me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; Come, this is
news, William.&nbsp; Pray where did you meet?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas when I
was in church last Sunday.&nbsp; In they came, the two young
maids from Luthers, like a couple of gallinie fowls, the way they
did step up over the stones and shake the plumes of them this way
and that.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t hold with fancy tricks.&nbsp; I
never could abide them.&nbsp; No foreign wenches for me.&nbsp;
And that&rsquo;s about all.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true
they are from town, but none the worse for that, William.&nbsp;
You have got sadly rude and cumbersome in your ways, or you
wouldn&rsquo;t feel as you do towards a suitable young
person.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis from getting about with John so much, I
think.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Now look you here,
Mother, I&rsquo;ve got used to my own ways, and when a
man&rsquo;s got set in his own ways, &rsquo;tis best to leave him
there.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m past the age for marrying, and you ought
to know this better than anyone.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; I know that
&rsquo;tis a rare lot of foolishness that you do talk, William,
seeing as you&rsquo;re not a year past thirty yet.&nbsp; But if
you can&rsquo;t be got to wed for love of a maid, perhaps
you&rsquo;ll do so for love of a purse, when &rsquo;tis fairly
filled.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s always
been enough for you and me so far, Mother.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; Ah, but that
won&rsquo;t last for ever.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m got an old woman, and
I can&rsquo;t do with the dairy nor the poultry as I was used to
do.&nbsp; And things have not the same prices to them as
&rsquo;twas a few years gone by.&nbsp; And last year&rsquo;s
season was the worst that I remember.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; So
&rsquo;twas.&nbsp; But so long as there&rsquo;s a roof over our
heads and a loaf of bread and a bit of garden for me to work on,
where&rsquo;s the harm, Mother?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; O you put me
out of all patience, William.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s the rent to
come from if we go on like this?&nbsp; And the clothing, and the
food?&nbsp; And John&rsquo;s wages, and your flower seeds, if it
comes to that, for you have got terrible wasteful over the
flowers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; I wish you&rsquo;d
take it quieter, Mother.&nbsp; Look at you bed of musk,
&rsquo;tis a grand smell that comes up from it all around.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; No,
William.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve no eye for musk, nor nose to smell at
it either till you&rsquo;ve spoken the word that I require.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Best let things bide
as they are, Mother.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
leave you no rest till you do as I wish, William.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
got an old woman, and &rsquo;tis hard I should be denied in aught
that I&rsquo;ve set my heart upon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Please to set it
upon something different, Mother, for I&rsquo;m not a marrying
man, and John he&rsquo;ll tell you the same thing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; John!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sick of the very name of him.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t think
how &rsquo;tis that you can lower yourself by being so close with
a common farm hand, William.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Ah, &rsquo;twould be
a rare hard matter to find the equal to John, Mother.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis of gold all through, and every bit of him, that he is
made.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t see many like John these days,
that&rsquo;s the truth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; Well, then,
John, won&rsquo;t be here much longer, for we shan&rsquo;t have
anything to give him if things go on like this.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d wed forty
wives sooner than lose John&mdash;and that I would.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not
asking you to wed forty.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis only one.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; And that one?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; The young
person who&rsquo;s got Luther&rsquo;s farm.&nbsp; Her name is
Julia.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Leaving his
flower border and walking up and down thoughtfully</i>.]&nbsp;
Would she be the one with the cherry colour ribbons to her
gown?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure
I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I was not at church last Sunday.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Or t&rsquo;other one
in green?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; You appear to
have used your eyes pretty well, William.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; O, I can see a
smartish bit about me when I choose.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; T&rsquo;other
wench is but the housekeeper.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Where did you get
that from?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas
Susan who told me.&nbsp; She got it off someone down in the
village.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Well, which of the
maids would have had the cherry-coloured ribbons to her,
Mother?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure
I don&rsquo;t know, but if you go up there courting this
afternoon, may happen that you&rsquo;ll find out.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; This
afternoon?&nbsp; O, that&rsquo;s much too sudden like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; Not a bit of
it.&nbsp; Recollect, your fancy has been set on her since
Sunday.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Come, Mother, you
can&rsquo;t expect a man to jump into the river all of a sudden
like this.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; I expect you to
go up there this very day and to commence telling her of your
feelings.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve got
no feelings that I can tell her of, Mother.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; Then
you&rsquo;ll please to find some, William.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a thing
that in all my life I&rsquo;ve never done as to go visiting of a
strange wench of an afternoon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; Then &rsquo;tis
time you did begin.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; And what&rsquo;s
more, I&rsquo;ll not do it, neither.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; Then I must
tell John that we have no further need of his services, for where
the money to pay him is to come from, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>[<i>She rolls up her knitting and rises</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Stop a moment,
Mother&mdash;stop a moment.&nbsp; Maybe &rsquo;twon&rsquo;t be so
bad when I&rsquo;ve got more used to the idea.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve
pitched it upon me so sudden like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; Rent day has
pitched upon me more sudden, William.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Look you, Mother,
I&rsquo;ll get and turn it about in my mind a bit.&nbsp; And,
maybe, I&rsquo;ll talk it over with John.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t do
more, can I now?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; Talk it over
with whom you please, William.&nbsp; But remember &rsquo;tis this
very afternoon that you have to start courting.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
laid your best clothes out all ready on your bed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Sighing
heavily</i>.]&nbsp; O then I count there&rsquo;s no way out of
it.&nbsp; But how am I to bring it off?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis that
I&rsquo;d like to know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; Maybe your man
will be able to give you some suitable advice.&nbsp; Such things
are beyond me, I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>
<p>[<i>She gathers up her work things</i>, <i>and with a
contemptuous look at her son</i>, <i>she goes slowly out of the
garden</i>.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">William</span> <i>remains on the path
lost in perturbed thought</i>.&nbsp; <i>Suddenly he goes to the
gate and calls loudly</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; John, John!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; [<i>From
afar</i>.]&nbsp; Yes, master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Calling</i>.]&nbsp; Come you here, John, as quick as you can
run.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; That I will,
master.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>hurries into the
garden</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; John, I&rsquo;m
powerful upset.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Mistress&rsquo;s fowls
bain&rsquo;t got among the flowers again, be they, Master
William?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; No, no, John.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t so bad as that.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m in a
smartish fix, I can tell you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; How&rsquo;s that,
master?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; John, did you ever
go a&rsquo;courting?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Well, master,
that&rsquo;s a thing to ask a man!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a
terrible serious matter, John.&nbsp; Did you ever go?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Courting?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Yes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Why, I count as I have
went a score of times, master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; A score of times,
John!&nbsp; But that was before you were got to the age you are
now?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Before that, and now,
master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; And now, John?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; To be sure, master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Then you know how
&rsquo;tis done?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Ah, that I does,
master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Well, John,
you&rsquo;re the man for me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Lord bless us, master,
but what have you to do with courting?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; You may well ask me,
John.&nbsp; Why, look you here&mdash;until this very morning, you
would say I was a quiet and a peaceable man, with the right place
for everything and everything in its place.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Ah, and that you was,
Master William.&nbsp; And a time for all things too, and a
decenter, proper gentleman no man ever served&mdash;that&rsquo;s
truth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Ah, John&mdash;the
mistress has set her will to change all this.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Now, you&rsquo;d knock
me down with a feather.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; That she has,
John.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got to set out courting&mdash;a thing
I&rsquo;ve never thought to do in all my living days.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; That I&rsquo;ll be
bound you have not, Master William, though a finer gentleman than
yourself is not to be found in all the country side.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; [<i>With shy
eagerness</i>.]&nbsp; Is that how I appear to you, John?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Ah, and that you does,
master.&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis the wonder with all for miles around
as how you&rsquo;ve been and kept yourself to yourself like this,
so many years.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Well, John, it
appears that I&rsquo;m to pass out of my own keeping.&nbsp; My
Sunday clothes are all laid out upon the bed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Bless my soul, Master
William, and &rsquo;tis but Thursday too.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t that a
proper day for this sort of business, John?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve always been
used to Saturday myself, but with a gentleman &rsquo;tis
different like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Well, John,
there&rsquo;s nothing in this day or that as far as I can
see.&nbsp; A bad job is a bad job, no matter what, and the day of
it does make but very little difference.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re right
there, master.&nbsp; But if I may be so bold, where is it as you
be going off courting this afternoon?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Ah&mdash;now you and
me will have a straight talk one with another&mdash;for
&rsquo;tis to you I look, John, for to pull me out of this fix
where the mistress has gone and put me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; And that I&rsquo;ll do,
master&mdash;with all the will in the world.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Well then, John,
&rsquo;tis to be one of those maids from strange parts who are
come to live at old Luther&rsquo;s, up yonder.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Ah, I seed the pair of
them in church last Sunday.&nbsp; Fine maids, the both of them,
and properly suitable if you was to ask me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis only the
one I&rsquo;ve got to court, John.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; And I reckon
that&rsquo;s one too many, Master William.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re right
there, John.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis Mistress Julia I&rsquo;ve to go
at.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; And which of the pair
would that be, Master William?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; That one with the
cherry colour ribbons to her gown, I believe.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Ah, t&rsquo;other was
plainer in her dressing, and did keep the head of her bent
smartish low on her book, so that a man couldn&rsquo;t get a fair
look upon she.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; That would be the
housekeeper or summat.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis Julia, who has the old
man&rsquo;s money, I&rsquo;m to court.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Well, master,
I&rsquo;ll come along with you a bit of the road, to keep your
heart up like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; You must do more
than that for me, John.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got to learn me how
the courting is done before I set off.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Why, master, courting
baint a thing what wants much learning, that&rsquo;s the
truth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis all new
to me, John.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m blessed if I know how to
commence.&nbsp; Why, the thought of it at once sends me hot all
over; and then as cold again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; You start and get your
clothes on, master.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis half the
battle&mdash;clothes.&nbsp; What a man cannot bring out of his
mouth of a Saturday will fall out easy as anything on the Sunday
with his best coat to his back.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; No, John.&nbsp; The
clothes won&rsquo;t help me in this fix.&nbsp; You must tell me
how to start once I get to the farm and am by the door.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; You might take a
nosegay with you, master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; I might.&nbsp; And
yet, &rsquo;tis a pity to cut the blooms for naught.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; I always takes a
nosegay with me, of a Saturday night.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Why, John, who is it
that you are courting then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis that wench
Susan, since you ask me, master.&nbsp; But not a word of it to
th&rsquo; old mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not
mention it, John.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Thank you kindly,
master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; And now, John, when
the nosegay&rsquo;s all gathered and the flowers bunched, what
else should I do?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Well, then you gives it
her when you gets to the door.&nbsp; And very like she&rsquo;ll
ask you into the parlour, seeing as you be a particular fine
looking gentleman.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; I could not stand
that, John.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve no tongue to me within a strange
house.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Well then, maybe as you
and she will sit aside of one another in an arbour in the garden,
or sommat of the sort.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Yes, John.&nbsp; And
what next?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m blessed if I
do know, master.&nbsp; You go along and commence.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; No, John, and that I
won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Not till I know more about it like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Well, master, I&rsquo;m
fairly puzzled hard to tell you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; I have the very
thought, John.&nbsp; Do you bring Susan out here.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll place myself behind the shrubs, and do you get and
court her as well as you know how; and maybe that will learn me
something.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Susan&rsquo;s a
terrible hard wench to court, Master William.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill make
the better lesson, John.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a stone in
place of a heart what Susan&rsquo;s got.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill very
likely be the same with Julia.&nbsp; Go and bring her quickly,
John.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">William</span> <i>places himself behind
the arbour</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; As you will,
master&mdash;but Susan have been wonderful nasty in her ways with
me of late.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis my belief as she have took up with
one of they low gipsy lads what have been tenting up yonder,
against the wood.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Well, &rsquo;twill
be your business to win her back to you, John.&nbsp; See&mdash;am
I properly hid, behind the arbour?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Grandly hid,
master&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go and fetch the wench.&nbsp; [<span
class="smcap">John</span> <i>leaves the garden</i>.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">William</span> <i>remains hidden behind
the arbour</i>.&nbsp; <i>After a few minutes</i> <span
class="smcap">John</span> <i>returns pulling</i> <span
class="smcap">Susan</span> <i>by the hand</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; And what are you
about, bringing me into master&rsquo;s flower garden at this time
of the morning?&nbsp; I should like for mistress to look out of
one of the windows&mdash;you&rsquo;d get into fine trouble, and
me too, John.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Susan, my dear, you be
a passing fine wench to look upon, and that&rsquo;s the
truth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; And is it to tell me
such foolishness that you&rsquo;ve brought me all the way out of
the kitchen?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Stooping and
picking a dandelion</i>.]&nbsp; And to give you this flower, dear
Susan.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Throwing it
down</i>.]&nbsp; A common thing like that!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have
none of it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis prime you
looks when you be angered, Susan.&nbsp; The blue fire do fairly
leap from your eyes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; O you&rsquo;re enough
to anger a saint, John.&nbsp; What have you brought me here
for?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; I thought I&rsquo;d
like to tell you as you was such a fine wench, Susan.&nbsp; And
that I did never see a finer.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; You do look at me as
though I was yonder prize heifer what Master William&rsquo;s so
powerful set on.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Ah&mdash;and &rsquo;tis
true as you have sommat of the look of she when you stands a
pawing of the ground as you be now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; Is it to insult me
that you&rsquo;ve got me away from the kitchen, John?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Nay&mdash;&rsquo;tis to
tell you that you be a rare smartish wench&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll
go along to the church with you any day as you will name, my
dear.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; That you won&rsquo;t,
John.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mind taking a nosegay of flowers from
you now and then, and hearing you speak nice to me over the
garden gate of an evening, but I&rsquo;m not a-going any further
along the road with you.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; [<i>She
moves towards the house</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Now, do you bide a
moment longer, Susan&mdash;and let me say sommat of all they
feelings which be stirring like a nest of young birds in my heart
for you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; They may stir within
you like an old waspes&rsquo; nest for all I care, John.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Come, Susan, put better
words to your tongue nor they.&nbsp; You can speak honey sweet
when it do please you to.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis mustard as
is the right food for you this morning, John.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; I gets enough of that
from mistress&mdash;I mean&mdash;well&mdash;I mean&mdash;[<i>in a
loud</i>, <i>clear voice</i>]&mdash;O mistress is a wonderful
fine woman and no mistake.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t say as
much when she comes round the corner and catches you a wasting of
your time like this, John.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Is it a waste of time
to stand a-drinking in the sweetness of the finest rose what
blooms, Susan?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; Is that me, John?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Who else should it be,
Susan?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; Well,
John&mdash;sometimes I think there&rsquo;s not much amiss with
you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; O Susan, them be grand
words.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; But then again&mdash;I
do think as you be getting too much like Master William.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; And a grander gentleman
than he never went upon the earth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; Cut and clipped and
trimmed and dry as that box tree yonder.&nbsp; And you be getting
sommat of the same fashion about you, John.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Then make me
differenter, Susan, you know the way.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not so sure
as I do, John.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Wed me come Michaelmas,
Susan.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; And that I&rsquo;ll
not.&nbsp; And what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;m not a-going to stop
here talking foolish with you any longer.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve work
to do within.&nbsp; [<span class="smcap">Susan</span> <i>goes
off</i>.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">John</span>, <i>mopping his face and
speaking regretfully as</i> <span class="smcap">William</span>
<i>steps from behind the arbour</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; There, master.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s courting for you.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the sort of
thing.&nbsp; And a caddling thing it is too.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis a
thing that you do rare finely and well, John.&nbsp; And
&rsquo;tis you and none other who shall do the job for me this
afternoon, there&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve come to in my
thoughts.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Master, master,
whatever have you got in your head now?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; See here,
John&mdash;we&rsquo;ll cut a nosegay for you to carry&mdash;some
of the best blooms I&rsquo;ll spare.&nbsp; And you, who know what
courting is, and who have such fine words to your tongue, shall
step up at once and do the business for me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Master, if &rsquo;twas
an acre of stone as you&rsquo;d asked me to plough, I&rsquo;d
sooner do it nor a job like this.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; John, you&rsquo;ve
been a good friend to me all the years that you have lived on the
farm, you&rsquo;ll not go and fail me now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Why not court the lady
with your own tongue, Master William?&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould have
better language to it nor what I can give the likes of she.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Your words are all
right, John.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t as though sensible speech
was needed.&nbsp; You do know what&rsquo;s wanted with the maids,
whilst I have never been used to them in any way whatever.&nbsp;
So let&rsquo;s say no more about it, but commence gathering the
flowers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Heavily</i>, <i>but
resigned</i>.]&nbsp; Since you say so, master.&nbsp; [<i>They
begin to gather flowers</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; What blooms do young
maids like the best, John?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Put in a sprig of
thyme, master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Yes&mdash;I can well
spare that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; And a rose that&rsquo;s
half opened, master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; It goes to my heart
to have a rose wasted on this business, John.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t
likely as you can get through courtship without parting with
sommat, master.&nbsp; Lucky if it baint gold as you&rsquo;re
called upon to spill.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s true,
John&mdash;I&rsquo;ll gather the rose&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; See here, master, the
lily and the pink.&nbsp; Them be brave flowers, the both of them,
and with a terrible fine scent coming out of they.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Put them into the
nosegay, John&mdash;And now&mdash;no more&mdash;&rsquo;Tis enough
waste for one day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a smartish
lot of blooms as good as done for, says I.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; A slow sowing and a
quick reaping, John.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis to be hoped
as &rsquo;twill be the same with the lady, master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; There, off you go,
John.&nbsp; And mind, &rsquo;tis her with the cherry ribbon to
her gown and bonnet.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Why, master, and her
might have a different ribbon to her head this day, being that
&rsquo;tis Thursday?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; An eye
like&mdash;like a bullace, John.&nbsp; And a grand colour to the
face of her like yon rose.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s enough,
Master William.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not pitch upon the wrong maid,
never fear.&nbsp; And now I&rsquo;ll clean myself up a bit at the
pump, and set off straight away.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Shaking</i>
<span class="smcap">John&rsquo;s</span> <i>hand</i>.]&nbsp; Good
luck to you, my man.&nbsp; And if you can bring it off quiet and
decent like without me coming in till at the last, why,
&rsquo;tis a five pound note that you shall have for your
trouble.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; You be a grand
gentleman to serve, Master William, and no mistake about
that.</p>

<h3>ACT II.&mdash;Scene 1.</h3>
<p><i>A wood</i>.&nbsp; <i>To the right a fallen tree</i> (<i>or
a bench</i>).&nbsp; <span class="smcap">John</span> <i>comes from
the left</i>, <i>a large bunch of flowers in his hand</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Out, and a taking of
the air in the wood, be they?&nbsp; Well, bless my soul, but
&rsquo;tis a rare caddling business what master&rsquo;s put upon
I.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis worse nor any job he have set me to in all
the years I&rsquo;ve been along of him, so &rsquo;tis.&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;m the one to bring it off slick and straight, and, bless
me, if I won&rsquo;t take and hide myself by yon great bush till
I see the wenches a-coming up.&nbsp; That&rsquo;ll give me time
to have a quiet look at the both and pick out she what
master&rsquo;s going a-courting of.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>puts himself behind some
thick bushes as</i> <span class="smcap">Julia</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Laura</span> <i>come forward</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Julia</span> <i>is very simply dressed</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Her head is bare</i>, <i>and she is carrying her white cotton
sunbonnet</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Laura</span> <i>wears
finer clothes and her bonnet is tied by bright ribbons of cherry
colour</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Stopping by the
bench</i>.]&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll sit down&mdash;&rsquo;Tis a warm
day, and I&rsquo;ve had enough of walking.</p>
<p>[<i>She sinks down on the seat</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking all round
her</i>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis beautiful and quiet here.&nbsp; O this
is ever so much better than the farm.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; The farm!&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s wrong with that, I should like to know?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; Everything.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis more like a prison than a home to me.&nbsp; Within the
house there&rsquo;s always work crying out to be done&mdash;and
outside I believe &rsquo;tis worse&mdash;work&mdash;nothing else
speaking to me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a sad
ungrateful girl.&nbsp; Why, there&rsquo;s many would give their
eyes to change with you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; But out here
&rsquo;tis all peace, and freedom.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s naught
calling out to be done.&nbsp; The flowers grow as they like, and
the breezes move them this way, and that.&nbsp; The ground is
thick with leaves and blossoms and no one has got to sweep it,
and the hard things with great noises to them, like pails and
churns, are far away and clean forgot.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t
much use as you&rsquo;ll be on the farm.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; I wish I&rsquo;d never
come nigh to it.&nbsp; I was happier far before.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a grand
life.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll see it as I do one of these days.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; No, that I shall
not.&nbsp; Every day that I wake and hear the cattle lowing
beneath my window I turn over on my pillow, and &rsquo;tis a
heart of lead that turns with me.&nbsp; The smell of the wild
flowers in the fields calls me, but &rsquo;tis to the dairy I
must go, to work.&nbsp; And at noonday, when the shade of the
woodland makes me thirsty for its coolness, &rsquo;tis the
kitchen I must be in&mdash;or picking green stuff for the
market.&nbsp; And so on till night, when the limbs of me can do
no more and the spirit in me is like a bird with the wing of it
broken.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll harden to
it all by winter time right enough.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; O I&rsquo;ll never
harden to it.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not that way I am made.&nbsp; Some
girls can set themselves down with four walls round them, and do
their task nor ask for anything beyond, but &rsquo;tis not so
with me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; How is it then with
you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Pointing</i>.]&nbsp; There&mdash;see that blue thing yonder
flying from one blossom to another.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how
&rsquo;tis with me.&nbsp; Shut me up close in one place, I
perish.&nbsp; Let me go free, and I can fly and live.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; You do talk a powerful
lot of foolishness that no one could understand.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; O, do not let us talk
at all.&nbsp; Let us bide still, and get ourselves refreshed by
the sweetness and the wildness of the forest.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span> <i>turns away and gives
herself up to the enjoyment of the wood around her</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span> <i>arranges her ribbons and
smoothes out her gown</i>.&nbsp; <i>Neither of them speak for a
few minutes</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking up and
pointing</i>.]&nbsp; See those strange folk over there?&nbsp;
What are they?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking in the
same direction</i>.]&nbsp; I know them.&nbsp; They are gipsies
from the hill near to us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; They should be driven
away then.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like such folk roosting
around.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; But I do.&nbsp; They
are friends to me.&nbsp; Many&rsquo;s the time I have run out at
dusk to speak with them as they sit round their fire.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; Then you didn&rsquo;t
ought to have done so.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s get off now, before they
come up.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; No, no.&nbsp; Let us
talk to them all.&nbsp; [<i>Calling</i>.]&nbsp; Tansie and Chris,
come you here and sit down alongside of us.&nbsp; [<span
class="smcap">Chris</span>, <span class="smcap">Nat</span>,
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Tansie</span> <i>come up</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chris</span>.&nbsp; Good morning to you,
mistress.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a fine brave day, to-day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; That it is,
Chris.&nbsp; There never was so fine a day.&nbsp; And we have
come to spend all of it in this forest.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Tansie</span>.&nbsp; Ah, but &rsquo;tis
warm upon the high road.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nat</span>.&nbsp; We be come right away
from the town, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; Then sit down, all of
you, and we will talk in the cool shade.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; Not here, if you
please.&nbsp; I am not used to such company.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; Not here?&nbsp; Very
well, my friends, let us go further into the wood and you shall
stretch yourselves under the green trees and we will all rest
there together.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; Well, what next!&nbsp;
You might stop to consider how &rsquo;twill look in the
parish.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; How what will
look?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; How &rsquo;twill look
for you to be seen going off in such company like this.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; The trees have not
eyes, nor have the grass, and flowers.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no one
to see me but you, and you can turn your head t&rsquo;other
way.&nbsp; Come Tansie, come Chris.&nbsp; [<i>She turns towards
the three gipsies</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Tansie</span>.&nbsp; Nat&rsquo;s in a
sorry way, this morning&mdash;baint you, Nat?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nat</span>.&nbsp; Let I be.&nbsp; You do
torment anyone till they scarce do know if they has senses to
them or no.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Tansie</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not one
to miss what you never had, Nat.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chris</span>.&nbsp; Let the lad bide in
quiet, will you.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a powerful little nagging wench
as you be.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; Why are you heavy and
sad this fine day, Nat?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Tansie</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis love
what&rsquo;s the matter with he, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; Love?&nbsp; O,
that&rsquo;s not a thing that should bring heaviness or gloom,
but lightness to the heart, and song to the lips.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Tansie</span>.&nbsp; Ah, but when
there&rsquo;s been no meeting in the dusk since Sunday, and no
message sent!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chris</span>.&nbsp; Keep that tongue of
your&rsquo;n where it should be, and give over, Tansie.&nbsp;
Susan&rsquo;s not one as would play tricks with her lad.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; Now I have a thirst to
hear all about this, Nat, so come off further into the wood, all
of you, where we can speak in quiet.</p>
<p>[<i>She holds out her hand to</i> <span
class="smcap">Nat</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; Upon my word, but
something must be done to bring these goings on to an end.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; Come, Nat&mdash;you
shall tell me all your trouble.&nbsp; I understand the things of
the heart better than Tansie, and I shall know how to give you
comfort in your distress&mdash;come!</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Julia</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Nat</span>, <i>followed by</i> <span
class="smcap">Chris</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Tansie</span>, <i>move off out of sight</i>.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Laura</span> <i>is left sitting on the bench
alone</i>.&nbsp; <i>Presently</i> <span class="smcap">John</span>
<i>comes out carefully from behind the bushes</i>, <i>holding his
bunch of flowers</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; A good day to you,
mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; The same to you,
master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Folks do call me
John.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; Indeed?&nbsp; Good
morning, John.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; A fine brave sun
to-day, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; But pleasant enough
here in the shade.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Now, begging your
pardon, but what you wants over the head of you baint one of
these great trees full of flies and insects, but an arbour
trailed all about with bloom, such as my master has down at his
place yonder.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; Indeed?&nbsp; And who
may your master be, John?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis Master
William Gardner, what&rsquo;s the talk of the country for miles
around, mistress.&nbsp; And that he be.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; Master William
Gardner!&nbsp; What, he of Road Farm?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; The very same,
mistress.&nbsp; And as grand a gentleman as anyone might wish for
to see.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; Yes&mdash;I seem to
have heard something told about him, but I don&rsquo;t rightly
remember what &rsquo;twas.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; You may have heard tell
as the finest field of beans this season, that&rsquo;s his.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think
&rsquo;twas of beans that I did hear.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Or that &rsquo;twas his
spotted hilt what fetched the highest price of any in the market
Saturday?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; No,
&rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t that neither.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Or that folks do come
as thick as flies on a summer&rsquo;s day from all parts of the
country for to buy the wheat what he do grow.&nbsp; Ah, and
before &rsquo;tis cut or like to be, they be a fighting for it,
all of them, like a pack of dogs with a bone.&nbsp; So
&rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t
that, I don&rsquo;t think.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Or &rsquo;twas that
th&rsquo; old missis&mdash;she as is mother to Master
William&mdash;her has a tongue what&rsquo;s sharper nor longer
than any vixen&rsquo;s going.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s between you
and I, missis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; Ah&mdash;&rsquo;Twas
that I did hear tell of.&nbsp; Now I remember it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; But Master
William&mdash;the tongue what he do keep be smooth as honey, and
a lady might do as she likes with him if one got the chance.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; Indeed?&nbsp; He must
be a pleasant sort of a gentleman.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; For he could be led
with kindness same as anything else.&nbsp; But try for to drive
him, as old Missis do&mdash;and very likely &rsquo;tis hoofed as
you&rsquo;ll get for your pains.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; I like a man with some
spirit to him, myself.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Ah, Master William has
a rare spirit to him, and that he has.&nbsp; You should hear him
when th&rsquo; old Missis&rsquo;s fowls be got into his flower
garden.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis sommat as is not likely to be forgot in
a hurry.&nbsp; That &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; You carry a handsome
nosegay of blossoms there, John.&nbsp; Are they from your
master&rsquo;s garden?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Ah, there&rsquo;re not
amiss.&nbsp; I helped for to raise they too.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; And to whom are you
taking them now, John?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; To the lady what my
master&rsquo;s a-courting of, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; And whom may that be,
John?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Why, &rsquo;tis
yourself, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; Me, John?&nbsp; Why,
I&rsquo;ve never clapped eyes on Master William Gardner so far as
I know of.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;ve clapped
eyes on you, mistress&mdash;&rsquo;twas at Church last
Sunday.&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis not a bit of food, nor a drop of
drink, nor an hour of sleep, as Master William have taken
since.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; O, you do surprise me,
John?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how
&rsquo;tis with he, mistress.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis many a year as
I&rsquo;ve served Master William&mdash;but never have I seen him
in the fix where he be in to-day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; Why&mdash;how is it
with him then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; As it might be with the
cattle when the flies do buzz about they, thick in the
sunshine.&nbsp; A-lashing this way and that, a-trampling and
a-tossing, and never a minute&rsquo;s rest.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; Well, now&mdash;to
think of such a thing.&nbsp; Indeed!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen a horse
right up to the neck of him in that old quag ahind of our
place&mdash;a-snorting and a-clapping with his teeth and
a-plunging so as &rsquo;twould terrify anyone to harken to
it.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s how &rsquo;tis to-day with Master
William up at home, so &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; And only saw me
once&mdash;at Church last Sunday, John?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Ah&mdash;and they old
maid flies do sting but once, but &rsquo;tis a terrible big bump
as they do raise on the flesh of anyone, that &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; O
John&mdash;&rsquo;tis a fine thing to be loved like that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; So I should
say&mdash;ah, &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t every day that a man like
Master William goes a-courting.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; But he hasn&rsquo;t
set out yet, John.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; You take and hold the
nosegay, mistress, and I&rsquo;ll go straight off and fetch him,
so being as you&rsquo;re agreeable.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; O yes, and that I am,
John&mdash;You go and fetch him quick.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll bide here
gladly, waiting till he comes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it.&nbsp;
I knowed you for a sensible lady the moment I pitched my eyes on
to you.&nbsp; And when master do come up, you take and talk to
him nicely and meek-like and lead him on from one thing to
t&rsquo;other: and you&rsquo;ll find as he&rsquo;ll go quiet as a
sheep after the first set off, spite of the great spirit
what&rsquo;s at the heart of he.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; John, I&rsquo;ll do
all as you say, and more than all.&nbsp; Only, you get along and
send him quickly to me.&nbsp; And&mdash;yes, you might give him a
good hint, John&mdash;I&rsquo;m not averse to his attentions.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Ah, and I should think
you wasn&rsquo;t, for &rsquo;twould be a hard job to find a nicer
gentleman nor Master William.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; That I know it
would.&nbsp; Why, John, my heart&rsquo;s commenced beating ever
so fast, it has.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Then you may reckon how
&rsquo;tis with the poor master!&nbsp; Why, &rsquo;tis my belief
as &rsquo;twill be raving madness as&rsquo;ll be the end of he if
sommat don&rsquo;t come to put a finish to this unrest.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; O John, &rsquo;twould
never do for such a fine gentleman to go crazy.&nbsp; Do you set
off quick and send him along to me, and I&rsquo;ll take and do my

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Rising and about to

Master William do require.&nbsp; But you be the one for to give
it him.&nbsp; You just bide where you do sit now whilst I goes

<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; O that I will, my

seat as I did leave she.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; We have kept her
waiting a bit too long whilst we were cutting the green
stuff.&nbsp; And now &rsquo;twill be best to let matters bide
over till to-morrow.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Why, master &rsquo;tis
my belief as you be all of a-tremble like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; I wish we were well
out of this business, John.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not to my liking in
any way.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a fine
looking lady, and that &rsquo;tis.&nbsp; You take and court her,
Master William.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; How am I to court
the wench when she&rsquo;s not here?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Pointing</i>.]&nbsp; Look yonder, master, there she comes
through them dark trees.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got to
bide somewhere nigh me, John.&nbsp; I could not be left alone
with a wench who&rsquo;s a stranger to me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you get
flustered, Master William.&nbsp; See here, I&rsquo;ll hide me
ahind of yon bushes, and if so be as you should want me, why,
there I&rsquo;m close at hand.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather you
did stand at my side, John.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>hides himself behind the

slowly up</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">William</span> <i>stands

she bows to him</i>.&nbsp; <i>For some moments they stand
embarrassed</i>, <i>looking at one another</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Suddenly
bringing out a bunch of carrots from his basket and holding them
up</i>.]&nbsp; See these young carrots, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; Indeed I do,
master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t
everywhere that you do see such fine grown ones for the time of
year.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re right
there, master.&nbsp; We have none of them up at our place.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Holding them
towards her</i>.]&nbsp; Then be pleased to accept these,
mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking the
carrots</i>.]&nbsp; Thank you kindly, master.&nbsp; [<i>There is
another embarrassed silence</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">William</span> <i>looks distractedly from</i> <span
class="smcap">Laura</span> <i>to his basket</i>.&nbsp; <i>Then he
takes out a bunch of turnips</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; You couldn&rsquo;t
beat these nowhere, not if you were to try.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure you
could not, master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; They do call this
sort the Early Snowball.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a foolish name for a
table root.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a beautiful
turnip.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Giving her the
bunch</i>.]&nbsp; You may as well have them too.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; O you&rsquo;re very
kind, master.</p>
<p>[<i>There is another long silence</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">William</span> <i>shuffles on his
feet</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Laura</span> <i>bends
admiringly over her gifts</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s young
beans and peas and a spring cabbage too, within the basket.&nbsp;
I do grow a little of most everything.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; O shall we sit down
and look at the vegetables together?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Visibly
relieved</i>.]&nbsp; We might do worse nor that.&nbsp; [<i>They
sit down side by side with the basket between them</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Lifting the
cabbage</i>.]&nbsp; O, this is quite a little picture!&nbsp; See
how the leaves do curl backwards&mdash;so fresh and green!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Ah, and that one has
a rare white heart to it, it has.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; I do love the taste of
a spring cabbage, when it has a slice of fat bacon along with
it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; I might have brought
a couple of pounds with me if I&rsquo;d have thought.&nbsp;
Mother do keep some rare mellow jowls a-hanging in the
pantry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Shyly</i>.]&nbsp;
Next time, maybe.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Eagerly</i>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t take ten minutes
for me to run back.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; Not now&mdash;O no
master&mdash;not now.&nbsp; Do you bide a little longer here and
tell me about&mdash;about t&rsquo;other things in the basket.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Mopping his face
with a handkerchief</i>.]&nbsp; Well&mdash;there&rsquo;s the
beans&mdash;I count that yours haven&rsquo;t come up very smart
this year.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; That they&rsquo;ve
not.&nbsp; The whole place has been let to run dreadful wild.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to show you how &rsquo;tis in my
garden, one of these days.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d be very
pleased to walk along with you there.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Hurriedly</i>.]&nbsp; Ah&mdash;you should see it later on
when the&mdash;the&mdash;the parsnips are a bit forrarder.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to see
the flower garden now, where this nosegay came from.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking round
uneasily</i>.]&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what the folks would say
if they were to see you and me a-going on the road in broad
day&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; Why, what should they
say, Master Gardner?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; They might get
saying&mdash;they might say as&mdash;as I&rsquo;d got a-courting,
or sommat foolish.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; Well&mdash;and would
that be untrue?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking at her
very uncomfortably</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;m blessed if I do
know&mdash;I mean&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; This nosegay&mdash;and
look, those young carrots&mdash;and the turnips and beans, why
did you bring them for me, master, unless it was that you
intended something by it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Very
confused</i>.]&nbsp; That&rsquo;s so.&nbsp; So &rsquo;tis.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s true.&nbsp; I count you have got hold of the sow by
the ear right enough this time.&nbsp; And the less said about it
the better.&nbsp; [<i>A slight silence</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking up shyly
in</i> <span class="smcap">William&rsquo;s</span> face.]&nbsp;
What was it drew you to me first, master?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; I believe
&rsquo;twas in Church on Sunday that I chanced to take notice of
you, like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; Yes, but what was it
about me that took your fancy in Church on Sunday?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m blessed if
I know, unless &rsquo;twas those coloured ribbons that you have
got to your bonnet.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; You are partial to the
colour?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Ah, &rsquo;tis well
enough.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; See here.&nbsp;
[<i>Taking a flower from her dress</i>.]&nbsp; This is of the
same colour.&nbsp; I will put it in your coat.</p>
<p>[<i>She fastens it in his coat</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">William</span> <i>looks very uncomfortable and
nervous</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Well, bless my soul,
but women folk have got some powerful strange tricks to them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Pinning the flower
in its place</i>.]&nbsp; There&mdash;my gift to you, master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; You may call me by
my name, if you like, &rsquo;tis more suitable, seeing that we
might go along to Church together one of these days.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; O William, you have
made me very happy&mdash;I do feel all mazy like with my
gladness.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Well, Julia, we
might do worse than to&mdash;to&mdash;name the day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; Why do you call me
Julia?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Seeing that
I&rsquo;ve given you leave to call me William &rsquo;tis only
suitable that I should use your name as well.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; But my name is not
Julia.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; What is it then, I
should like to know?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis Laura,
William.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Folks did tell me
that you were named Julia.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; No&mdash;Laura is my
name; but I live with Mistress Julia up at Luther&rsquo;s Farm,
and I help her with the work.&nbsp; House-keeping, dairy,
poultry, garden.&nbsp; O there&rsquo;s nothing I can&rsquo;t turn
my hand to, Master William.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Starts up from
the seat in deepest consternation</i>.]&nbsp; John,
John&mdash;Come you here, I say!&nbsp; Come here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Emerges from the
bushes</i>.]&nbsp; My dearest master!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s this
you&rsquo;ve been and done, John?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Why, master&mdash;the
one with the cherry ribbons, to her you did say.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Disgustedly</i>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the wrong one.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; What are you two
talking about?&nbsp; William, do you mean to say as that man of
yours was hid in the bushes all the while?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Now, John,
you&rsquo;ve got to get me out of the fix where I&rsquo;m
set.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; O my dear master,
don&rsquo;t you take on so.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a little bit of
misunderstanding to be sure, but one as can be put right very
soon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Then you get to work
and set it right, John, for &rsquo;tis beyond the power of me to
do so.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be blessed if I&rsquo;ll ever get
meddling with this sort of job again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Now don&rsquo;t you get
so heated, master, but leave it all to me.&nbsp; [<i>Turning
to</i> <span class="smcap">Laura</span>.]&nbsp; My good wench, it
seems that there has been a little bit of misunderstanding
between you and my gentleman here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Angrily</i>.]&nbsp; So that&rsquo;s what you call
it&mdash;misunderstanding &rsquo;tis a fine long word, but not
much of meaning, to it, I&rsquo;m thinking.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Then you do think
wrong.&nbsp; Suppose you was to go to market for to buy a nice
spring chicken and when you was got half on the way to home you
was to see as they had put you up a lean old fowl in place of it,
what would you do then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see that
chickens or fowls have anything to do with the matter.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Then you&rsquo;re not
the smart maid I took you for.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not you as would
be suitable in my master&rsquo;s home.&nbsp; And what&rsquo;s
more, &rsquo;tis not you as my master&rsquo;s come a-courting
of.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; If &rsquo;tis not me,
who is it then?</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">William</span> <i>looks at her sheepishly
and then turns away</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis your
mistress, since you wants to know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Indignantly</i>.]&nbsp; O, I see it all now&mdash;How could I
have been so misled!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; However could poor
master have been so mistook, I say.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Turning away
passionately</i>.]&nbsp; O, I&rsquo;ve had enough of you
and&mdash;and your master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Now that&rsquo;s what I
do like for to hear.&nbsp; Because me and master have sommat else
to do nor to stand giddle-gaddling in this old wood the rest of
the day.&nbsp; Us have got a smartish lot of worry ahead of we,
haven&rsquo;t us, master?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; You never said a
truer word, John.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Come along then Master
William.&nbsp; You can leave the spring vegetables to she.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis more nor she deserves, seeing as her might have known
as &rsquo;twas her mistress the both of us was after, all the
time.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Laura</span> <i>throws herself on the
seat and begins to cry silently</i>, <i>but passionately</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; O John, this
courting, &rsquo;tis powerful heavy work.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking</i> <span
class="smcap">William&rsquo;s</span> <i>arm</i>.]&nbsp; Come you
along with me, master, and I&rsquo;ll give you a helping hand
with it all.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking up and
speaking violently</i>.]&nbsp; I warrant you will, you
clown.&nbsp; But let me advise you to look better afore you leap
next time, or very likely &rsquo;tis in sommat worse than a
ditchful of nettles as you&rsquo;ll find yourself.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking back over
his shoulders as he goes off with</i> <span
class="smcap">William</span>.]&nbsp; I reckon as you&rsquo;ve no
call to trouble about we, mistress.&nbsp; Us is they what can
look after theirselves very well.&nbsp; Suppose you was to wash
your face and dry your eyes and set about the boiling of yon
spring cabbage.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould be sensibler like nor to bide
grizzling after one as is beyond you in his station, so
&rsquo;twould.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>and</i> <span

listed.&nbsp; If I had a mind to sleep when the sun was up, then
I did sleep.&nbsp; And if my limbs would not rest when
&rsquo;twas dark, why, then I did roam.&nbsp; There was naught to

<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a farmer,
Tansie.&nbsp; And for a farmer &rsquo;tis work of one sort, or
t&rsquo;other from when the sun is up till the candle has burned
itself short.&nbsp; If &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t working with my own
hands, &rsquo;tis driving of the hands of another.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chris</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard tell

<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; And what is gold to
me, Chris, who have no one but myself to spend it on?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chris</span>.&nbsp; Folks do say as the

<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; It will never bring

<p><span class="smcap">Chris</span>.&nbsp; Come, mistress,
&rsquo;tis a fine thing to have a great stone roof above the head
of you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d sooner get
my shelter from the green leaves.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nat</span>.&nbsp; And a grand thing to
have your victuals spread afore you each time &rsquo;stead of
having to go lean very often.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; O, a handful of
berries and a drink of fresh water is enough for me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Tansie</span>.&nbsp; And beautiful it must
be to stretch the limbs of you upon feathers when night do come
down, with a fine white sheet drawn up over your head.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; O, I could rest more
sweetly on the grass and moss yonder.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nat</span>.&nbsp; I did never sleep within
four walls but once, and then &rsquo;twas in gaol.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; O Nat, you were never
in gaol, were you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nat</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas that they
mistook I for another.&nbsp; And when the morning did come, they
did let I go again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chris</span>.&nbsp; I count &rsquo;twas a
smartish long night, that!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nat</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas enough for
to shew me how it do feel when anyone has got to bide sleeping
with the walls all around of he.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; And the ceiling above,
Nat.&nbsp; And locked door.&nbsp; And other folk lying breathing
in the house, hard by.&nbsp; All dark and close.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chris</span>.&nbsp; And where us may lie,
the air do run swift over we.&nbsp; We has the smell of the earth
and the leaves on us as we do sleep.&nbsp; There baint no
darkness for we, for the stars do blink all night through up
yonder.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Tansie</span>.&nbsp; And no sound of other
folk breathing but the crying of th&rsquo; owls and the
foxes&rsquo; bark.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; Ah, that must be a
grand sound, the barking of a fox.&nbsp; I never did hear
one.&nbsp; Never.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chris</span>.&nbsp; Ah, &rsquo;tis a
powerful thin sound, that&mdash;but one to raise the hair on a
man&rsquo;s head and to clam the flesh of he, at dead of
night.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nat</span>.&nbsp; You come and bide along
of we one evening, and you shall hearken to the fox, and badger
too, if you&rsquo;ve the mind.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; O that would please me
more than anything in the world.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Tansie</span>.&nbsp; And when &rsquo;twas
got a little lighter, so that the bushes could be seen, and the
fields, I&rsquo;d shew you where the partridge has her nest
beneath the hedge; where we have gotten eggs, and eaten them
too.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chris</span>.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll take

clear as a diamond over the stones.&nbsp; And if you bides there

there&rsquo;s a dinner such as the Queen might not get every day

up</i>.]&nbsp; Why, there&rsquo;s Susan coming.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking in the

<p><span class="smcap">Tansie</span>.&nbsp; I count as her has
had a smartish job to get away from th&rsquo; old missis so early
in the day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chris</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a rare old
she cat, and handy with the claw&rsquo;s of her, Susan&rsquo;s
missis.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Susan</span> <i>comes shyly
forward</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nat</span>.&nbsp; Come you here, Susan,
and sit along of we.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; Yes, sit down with us
in this cool shade, Susan.&nbsp; You look warm from running.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; O, I didn&rsquo;t know
you was here, Mistress Julia.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; Well, Susan, and so
you live at Road Farm.&nbsp; Are you happy there?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; I should be if
&rsquo;twern&rsquo;t for mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; No mistress could
speak harshly to you, Susan&mdash;you are so young and
pretty.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; Ah, but mistress takes
no account of aught but the work you does, and the tongue of her
be wonderful lashing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; Then how comes it that
you have got away to the forest so early on a week day?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis that
mistress be powerful took up with sommat else this afternoon, and
so I was able to run out for a while and her didn&rsquo;t notice
me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Tansie</span>.&nbsp; Why Su, what&rsquo;s
going on up at the farm so particular to-day?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
courting.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">All</span>.&nbsp; Courting?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; That
&rsquo;tis.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis our Master William what&rsquo;s
dressed up in his Sunday clothes and gone a-courting with a
basket of green stuff on his arm big enough to fill the market,
very nigh.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chris</span>.&nbsp; Well, well,
who&rsquo;d have thought he had it in him?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nat</span>.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a gentleman
what&rsquo;s not cut out for courting, to my mind.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; Indeed he isn&rsquo;t,
Nat.&nbsp; And however the mistress got him dressed and set off
on that business, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; But you have not told
us who the lady is, Susan.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Suddenly very
embarrassed</i>.]&nbsp; I&mdash;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t think as I do
rightly know who &rsquo;tis, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chris</span>.&nbsp; Why, look you, Susan,
you&rsquo;ll have to take and hide yourself if you don&rsquo;t
want for them to know as you be got along of we.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that,
Chris?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chris</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Pointing</i>.]&nbsp; See there, that man of Master
Gardner&rsquo;s be a-coming along towards us fast.&nbsp; Look
yonder&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; O whatever shall I
do?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis John, and surely he will tell of me when he
gets back.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nat</span>.&nbsp; Come you off with me
afore he do perceive you, Susan.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take you where
you shall bide hid from all the Johns in the world if
you&rsquo;ll but come along of me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it.&nbsp;
Take her off, Nat; take her, Tansie.&nbsp; And do you go along
too, Chris, for I have a fancy to bide alone in the stillness of
the wood for a while.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Susan</span>, <span

Julia?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Slowly</i>.]&nbsp;
Only for a little moment, Chris; then you can come for me
again.&nbsp; I would like to stay with myself in quiet for a
while.&nbsp; New thoughts have come into my mind and I cannot
rightly understand what they do say to me, unless I hearken to
them alone.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chris</span>.&nbsp; Then I&rsquo;ll leave
you, Julia.&nbsp; For things be stirring powerful in my mind too,
and I&rsquo;d give sommat for to come to an understanding with
they.&nbsp; Ah, that I would.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; Why, you&rsquo;re
Master Gardner&rsquo;s farm hand, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Ah, that&rsquo;s right
enough.&nbsp; And there be jobs as I wish Master William would
get and do for hisself instead of putting them on I.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; Well, and how far may
you be going this afternoon?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; I baint going no
further than where I be a-standing now, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; It would appear that
your business was with me, then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Ah, you&rsquo;ve hit
the right nail, mistress.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis with you.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis a straight offer as my master have sent me out for to
make.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; Now I wonder what sort
of an offer that might be!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
master&rsquo;s hand in marriage, and a couple of pigs jowls,
home-cured, within this here basket.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; O my good man,
you&rsquo;re making game of me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; And that I baint,
mistress.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas in the church as Master William seed
you first.&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis very nigh sick unto death with
love as he have been since then.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; Is he too sick to come
and plead his cause himself, John?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Ah, and that he
be.&nbsp; Do go moulting about the place with his victuals left
upon the dish&mdash;a sighing and a grizzling so that any maid
what&rsquo;s got a heart to th&rsquo; inside of she would be
moved in pity, did she catch ear of it, and would lift he out of
the torment.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; Well, John, I&rsquo;ve
not seen or heard any of this sad to-do, so I can&rsquo;t be
moved in pity.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Ah, do you look within
this basket at the jowls what Master William have sent you.&nbsp;
Maybe as they&rsquo;ll go to your heart straighter nor what any
words might.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>sits down on the bench

<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; I have no liking for
pigs&rsquo; meat myself.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Master&rsquo;s pig meat
be different to any in the county, mistress.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell
her,&rdquo; says Master William, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis a rare fine
bit of mellow jowl as I be a sending she.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; O John, I&rsquo;m a
very poor judge of such things.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; And look you
here.&nbsp; I never seed a bit of Master William&rsquo;s
home-cured sent out beyond the family to no one till this
day.&nbsp; No, that I have not, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Shutting the

John, so it may be returned again to the family.&nbsp; I am sorry
you had the trouble of bringing it so far.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; You may not be partial
to pig meat, mistress, but you&rsquo;ll send back the key of
Master William&rsquo;s heart same as you have done the jowls.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; I have no use for the
key of Master William&rsquo;s heart either, John.&nbsp; And you
may tell him so, from me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Why, mistress.&nbsp;
You don&rsquo;t know what you be a talking of.&nbsp; A man like
my master have never had to take a No in place of Yes in all the
born days of him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Rising</i>.]&nbsp;
Then he&rsquo;ll have to take it now, John.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m
thinking &rsquo;tis time you set off home again with your
load.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Well, mistress, I
don&rsquo;t particular care to go afore you have given me a good
word or sommat as&rsquo;ll hearten up poor Master William in his
love sickness.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; Truly, John, I
don&rsquo;t know what you would have me say.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; I warrant there be no
lack of words to the inside of you, if so be as you&rsquo;d open
you mouth a bit wider.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not silence as a maid is
troubled with in general.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; O, I have plenty of
words ready, John, should you care to hear them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Then out with them,
Mistress Julia, and tell the master as how you&rsquo;ll take the
offer what he have made you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never seen
your master, John, but I know quite enough about him to say
I&rsquo;ll never wed with him.&nbsp; Please to make that very
clear when you get back.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis plain as you
doesn&rsquo;t know what you be a talking of.&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis
a wonder as how such foolishness can came from the mouth of a
sensible looking maid like yourself.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; I shall not marry
Master William Gardner.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; I reckon as
you&rsquo;ll be glad enough to eat up every one of them words the
day you claps eyes on Master William, for a more splendid
gentleman nor he never fetched his breath.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll never wed a
farmer, John.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; And then, look at the
gift what Master William&rsquo;s been and sent you.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t to everyone as master do part with his pig
meat.&nbsp; That &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Rising</i>.]&nbsp;
Well, you can tell your master I&rsquo;m not one that can be
courted with a jowl, mellow or otherwise.&nbsp; And that
I&rsquo;ll not wed until I can give my heart along with my
hand.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to know
where you would find a better one nor master for to give your
heart to, mistress?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; May be I have not far
to search.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking up the

home and tell your master he can hang up his meat again in the
larder, for all that it concerns me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be blowed if
I do say anything of the sort, mistress.&nbsp; I shall get and
tell Master William as you be giving a bit of thought to the
matter, and that jowls not being to your fancy, &rsquo;tis very
like as a dish of trotters may prove acceptabler.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; Say what you like,

right, William, for sending the man when you should have gone
yourself.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; John has a tongue
that is better used to this sort of business than mine.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; Nonsense, when
was one of our family ever known to fail in the tongue?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; If she that was
asked first had only been the right one, all would have been over
and done with now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis John
that you have got to thank for the blunder.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Sighing</i>.]&nbsp; That was a rare fine maid, and no
mistake.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; And a rare
brazen hussy, from all that has reached my ears.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp;
Well&mdash;I&rsquo;ve done with courting&mdash;now and for all
time, that I have.&nbsp; And you may roast me alive if I&rsquo;ll
ever go nigh to a maid again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; That you shall,
William&mdash;and quickly too.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no time like
the present, and your Sunday clothes are upon you still.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; I was just going up
to change, Mother.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; Then
you&rsquo;ll please to remain as you are.&nbsp; You may take what
gift you like along with you this time, so long as it&rsquo;s
none of my home-cured meat.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m blessed if
I do stir out again this day.&nbsp; Why, look at the seedlings
crying for water, and the nets to lay over the fruit and sommat
of everything wanting to be done all around of me.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll not stir.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>comes towards
them</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s
John.&nbsp; Suppose he were to make himself useful in the garden
for once instead of meddling in things that are none of his
business.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be blowed if
&rsquo;tis any more courting as I&rsquo;ll do, neither for Master
William nor on my own account.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Why, John,
&rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t your fault that the lady wouldn&rsquo;t take
me, you did your best with her, I know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; An that I did, Master
William, but a more contrary coxsy sort of a maid I never did
see.&nbsp; &ldquo;I baint one as fancies pig meat,&rdquo; her did
say.&nbsp; And the nose of she did curl away up till it could go
no higher.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s not the wench for me, I says to
myself.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; Is the jowl
hung up in its right place again, John?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; That &rsquo;tis,
mistress.&nbsp; I put it back myself, and a good job for that
&rsquo;taint went out of the family and off to the mouths of
strangers, so says I.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; Do you tend to
Master William&rsquo;s garden John, instead of talking.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ve had enough of your tongue for one day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Why, be Master William
goin&rsquo; out for to court again, this afternoon?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; No, John&mdash;No,
I&rsquo;ve had enough of that for my life time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; So have I, master, and
more nor enough.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care particular if I never
set eyes on a maid again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Pointing to a
plot of ground</i>.]&nbsp; That&rsquo;s where I pulled the young
carrots this morning.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Ah, and so you did,
master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s
from where I took the Early Snowballs.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; And a great pity as you
did.&nbsp; There be none too many of that sort here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; She had a wonderful
soft look in her eyes as she did handle them and the spring
cabbage, John.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Ah, and a wonderful
hard tongue when her knowed &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t for she as they
was pulled.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Was t&rsquo;other
maid anything of the same pattern, John?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Upon my word, if
t&rsquo;other wasn&rsquo;t the worst of the two, for she did put
a powerful lot of venom into the looks as she did give I, and the
words did fall from she like so many bricks on my head.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; Pity the first was
not the right maid.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Ah, a maid what can
treat a prime home-cured jowl as yon did baint the sort for to
mistress it over we, I&rsquo;m thinking.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; See here,
John&mdash;suppose you were to let your tongue bide still in its
home awhile, and start doing something with your hands.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right
enough, mistress.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s wanted, Master William?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m blessed if
I can recollect, John.&nbsp; This courting business lies heavy on
me, and I don&rsquo;t seem able to get above it, like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d let it alone,
master, if I was you.&nbsp; They be all alike, the maids.&nbsp;
And &rsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t be amiss if we was to serve they as we
serves the snails when they gets to the young plants.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Susan</span> <i>comes hurriedly into the
garden</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; Please master, please
mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; What do you
mean, Susan, by coming into the garden without your cap?&nbsp; Go
and put it on at once.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; The wind must have
lifted it from me, mistress, for I was running ever so fast.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; Do you expect
me to believe that, Susan&mdash;and not a breath stirring the
flowers or trees, or anything?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas the lady I
met as&mdash;as&mdash;as I was coming across the field from
feeding the fowls.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; What lady,
Susan?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; Her from
Luther&rsquo;s, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; And what of she; out
with it, wench.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; She did tell I to say
as she be coming along as fast as she may after Master
William.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; [<i>As though to
himself with an accent of despair</i>.]&nbsp; No.&nbsp; No.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; There, master,
didn&rsquo;t I tell you so?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Very
nervously</i>.]&nbsp; What did you tell me, John?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; That, let her abide and
her&rsquo;d find the senses of she presently.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; O I&rsquo;m blessed
if I do know what to do.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>takes his master&rsquo;s
arm and draws him aside</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; You pluck up your
heart, my dearest master, and court she hard.&nbsp; And in less
nor a six months &rsquo;tis along to church as you&rsquo;ll be
a-driving she.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; But John, &rsquo;tis
t&rsquo;other with the cherry ribbons that has taken all my
fancy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; No, no, Master
William.&nbsp; You take and court the mistress.&nbsp; You take
and tame the young vixen, and get the gold and silver from
she.&nbsp; T&rsquo;other wench is but the serving maid.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; The lady&rsquo;s
coming along ever so quickly, master.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>, <i>rising and
folding up her knitting</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
please to come indoors with me, William, and I&rsquo;ll brush you
down and make you look more presentable than you appear just
now.&nbsp; Susan, you&rsquo;ll get a cap to you head at once, do
you hear me!&nbsp; And John, take and water master&rsquo;s
seedlings.&nbsp; Any one can stand with their mouths open and
their eyes as big as gooseberries if they&rsquo;ve a mind.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis not particular sharp to do so.&nbsp; Come,
William.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like a
word or two with John first, Mother.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; You come along
with me this moment, William.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a too many words
by far that you&rsquo;ve had with John already, and much good
they&rsquo;ve done to you.&nbsp; Come you in with me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; O I&rsquo;m blessed
if I do know whether &rsquo;tis on my head or on my feet that
I&rsquo;m standing.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">William</span> <i>follows his mother

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Well&mdash;if ever
there was a poor, tormented animal &rsquo;tis the master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; Ah, mistress should
have been born a drover by rights.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a grand
nagging one as her&rsquo;d have made, and sommat what no beast
would ever have got the better of.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t stand
in Master William&rsquo;s shoes, not if you was to put me knee
deep in gold.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; Nor I.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Ah, this courting
business, &rsquo;tis a rare caddling muddle when &rsquo;tis all
done and said.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis according
as some folks do find it, Master John.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a smartish
lot as you&rsquo;ll get of it come Sunday night, my wench.&nbsp;
You wait and see.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; That shews how little
you do know.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill be better nor ever with me
then.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill be alone
by yourself as you&rsquo;ll go walking, Su.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll see about
that when the time comes, John.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; All I says is that I
baint a-going walking with you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; I never walk with two,
John.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have to
learn to go in your own company.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; I shall go by the side
of my husband by then, very likely.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Your husband?&nbsp;
What tales be you a-giving out now?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis to Nat as
I&rsquo;m to be wed come Saturday.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Get along with you,
Susan, and put a cap to your head.&nbsp; Mistress will be coming
out presently, and then you know how &rsquo;twill be if her
catches you so.&nbsp; Get along in with you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; Now you don&rsquo;t
believe what I&rsquo;m telling you&mdash;but it&rsquo;s true, O
it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Look
here&mdash;There&rsquo;s company at the gate, and you a-standing
there like any rough gipsy wench on the road.&nbsp; Get you in
and make yourself a decenter appearance and then go and tell the
mistress as they be comed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Preparing to go
indoors and speaking over her shoulder</i>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis in
the parson&rsquo;s gown as you should be clothed, Master
John.&nbsp; Ah, &rsquo;tis a wonderful wordy preacher as you
would make, to be sure.&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis a rare crop as one
might raise with the seed as do fall from your mouth.</p>
<p>[<i>She goes indoors</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Julia</span> <i>comes leisurely into the
garden</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; Well, John, and how
are you feeling now?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Nicely, thank you,
mistress.&nbsp; See yon arbour?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; And that I do,
John.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Well, you may go and
sit within it till the master has leisure to come and speak with
you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; Thank you, John, but I
would sooner stop and watch you tend the flowers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis all one to
me whether you does or you does not.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; Now, John, you are
angry with me still.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; I likes a wench as do
know the mind of she, and not one as can blow hot one moment and
cold the next.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; There was never a
moment when I did not know my own mind, John.&nbsp; And
that&rsquo;s the truth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Well, us won&rsquo;t
say no more about that.&nbsp; &rsquo;Taint fit as there should be
ill feeling nor quarrelling &rsquo;twixt me and you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re right,
John.&nbsp; And there was something that I had it in my mind to
ask you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; You can say your
fill.&nbsp; There baint no one but me in the garden.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; John, you told me that
since Sunday your master has been sick with love.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right
enough, mistress.&nbsp; I count as we shall bury he if sommat
don&rsquo;t come to his relief.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; Now, John, do you look
into my eyes and tell me if &rsquo;tis for love of Julia or of
Laura that your master lies sickening.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d best go and
ask it of his self, mistress.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a smartish lot of
work as I&rsquo;ve got to attend to here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; You can go on working,
John.&nbsp; I am not hindering you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; No more than one of
they old Juney bettels a-roaring and a-buzzin round a man&rsquo;s
head.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; Now, John&mdash;you
must tell me which of the two it is.&nbsp; Is it Laura whom your
master loves, or Julia?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis Julia, then,
since you will have it out of me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; No, John, you&rsquo;re
not looking straight at me.&nbsp; You are looking down at the
flower bed.&nbsp; Let your eyes meet mine.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking up
crossly</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got my work to think of.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not one to stand cackling with a maid.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; Could you swear me it
is Julia?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis naught to I
which of you it be.&nbsp; There bide over, so as I can get the
watering finished.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Seizes the
watering can</i>.]&nbsp; Now, John, you have got to speak the
truth to me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Give up yon can, I tell
you.&nbsp; O you do act wonderful unseemly for a young lady.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Withholding the
can</i>.]&nbsp; Not till I have the truth from you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Angrily</i>.]&nbsp;
Well then, is it likely that my master would set his fancy on
such a plaguy, wayward maid?&nbsp; Why, Master William do know
better nor to do such a thing, I can tell you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; Then &rsquo;tis for
Laura that he is love-sick, John.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Give I the watering
can.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Giving him the
can</i>.]&nbsp; Here it is, dear John.&nbsp; O I had a fancy all
the time that &rsquo;twas to Laura your master had lost his
heart.&nbsp; And now I see I made no mistake.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t have
spoke as I did if you hadn&rsquo;t a buzzed around I till I was
drove very nigh crazy.&nbsp; Master William, he&rsquo;ll never
forgive me this.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; That he will,
I&rsquo;m sure, when he has listened to what I have got to say to
him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; You do set a powerful
store on what your tongue might say, but I&rsquo;d take and bide
quiet at home if I was you and not come hunting of a nice
reasonable gentleman like master, out of his very garden.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; O John, you&rsquo;re a
sad, ill-natured man, and you misjudge me very unkindly.&nbsp;
But I&rsquo;ll not bear malice if you will just run in and tell
your master that I want a word with him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; A word?&nbsp; Why not
say fifty?&nbsp; When was a maid ever satisfied with one word
I&rsquo;d like to know?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; Well&mdash;I
shan&rsquo;t say more than six, very likely, so fetch him to me
now, John, and I&rsquo;ll wait here in the garden.&nbsp; [<span
class="smcap">John</span> <i>looks at her with exasperated
contempt</i>.&nbsp; <i>Then he slowly walks away towards the
house</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Julia</span> <i>goes in the

curtains to the windows of it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chris</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Sullenly</i>.]&nbsp; Ah&mdash;I sees it all very well.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; And all this could be
mine for the stretching out of a hand.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chris</span>.&nbsp; Then stretch it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould be like
putting a wild bird into a gilded cage, to set me here in this
place.&nbsp; No, I must go free with you, Chris&mdash;and we will
wander where our spirits lead us&mdash;over all the world if we
have a mind to do so.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chris</span>.&nbsp; Please God
you&rsquo;ll not grieve at your choice.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; That I never
shall.&nbsp; Now call to Laura.&nbsp; Is she in the lane
outside?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chris</span>.&nbsp; There, she be come to
the gate now.</p>

William catches sight of you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; No, John.&nbsp; These

your master.</p>

grave as poor Master William will be landed soon if you

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Comes forward
timidly</i>.]&nbsp; And me and Nat are to be married too,
mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; I should have
given you notice anyhow to-night, Susan, so perhaps it&rsquo;s
just as well you have made sure of some sort of a roof to your
head.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nat</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill be but the
roof of th&rsquo; old cart, mistress; but I warrant as
her&rsquo;ll sleep bravely under it, won&rsquo;t you, Su.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; That I shall, dear

&rsquo;tis hard to keep up with all these goings on, and no

still and watch us as we go.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chris</span>.&nbsp; But there, you
needn&rsquo;t look downhearted, master, for I knows someone
as&rsquo;ll give you a rare warm welcome if so be as you should
change your mind and take your chance in the open, same as
we.</p>

first one of the season!&nbsp; O, isn&rsquo;t it a picture!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>.&nbsp; O Laura, &rsquo;tis a
fine wedding gift to be sure.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Stepping up
to</i> <span class="smcap">John</span>.]&nbsp; John, my man,
here&rsquo;s a five pound note to your pocket.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
never have won this lady here if it hadn&rsquo;t been for
you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking the
note</i>.]&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t name it, dear master.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis a long courtship what has no ending to it, so I always
says.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gardner</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis one
upset after another, but suppose you were to make yourself useful
for once, Susan, and bring out the tray with the cake and glasses
on it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Ah, that&rsquo;s it,
and I&rsquo;ll go along of she and help draw the cider.&nbsp;
Courtship be powerful drying work.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking into</i>
<span class="smcap">William&rsquo;s</span> <i>eyes</i>.]&nbsp; O
William, &rsquo;twas those Early Snowballs that did first stir up
my heart.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas John who
thought of them.&nbsp; Why, John has more sensible thoughts to
the mind of him than any other man in the world&mdash;and when
the cider is brought, &rsquo;tis to John&rsquo;s health we will
all drink.</p>

<h3>ACT I.&mdash;Scene 1.</h3>
<p><i>A village green</i>.&nbsp; <i>Some girls with market
baskets come on to it</i>, <i>each one carrying a leaflet which
she is earnestly reading</i>.</p>
<p><i>Gradually all the girls approach from different sides
reading leaflets</i>.</p>
<p><i>Under a tree at the far end of the green the old gipsy is
sitting&mdash;she lights a pipe and begins to smoke as</i> <span
class="smcap">Rose</span>, <i>her basket full of market
produce</i>, <i>comes slowly forward reading her sheet of
paper</i>.&nbsp; <i>She is followed by</i> <span
class="smcap">Marion</span>&mdash;<i>also reading</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Well, &rsquo;tis like
to be a fine set out, this May Day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marion</span>.&nbsp; I can make naught of
it myself.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Why, &rsquo;tis Lord
Cullen putting it about as how he be back from the war and
thinking of getting himself wed, like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marion</span>.&nbsp; I understands that
much, I do.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Only he can&rsquo;t
find the maid what he&rsquo;s lost his heart to.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marion</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Reading</i>.]&nbsp; The wench what his lordship did see
a-dancing all by herself in the forest when he was hid one day
all among the brambles, a-rabbiting or sommat.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; And when my lord would
have spoke with her, the maid did turn and fled away quick as a
weasel.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marion</span>.&nbsp; And his lordship off
to the fighting when &rsquo;twas next morn.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; So now, each maid of us
in the village and all around be to dance upon the green come May
Day so that my lord may see who &rsquo;twas that pleased his
fancy.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Susan</span> <i>comes up and stands
quietly listening</i>.&nbsp; <i>She is bare foot and her skirt is
ragged</i>, <i>she wears a shawl over her shoulders and her hair
is rough and untidy</i>.&nbsp; <i>On her arm she carries a basket
containing a few vegetables and other marketings</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marion</span>.&nbsp; And when he do pitch
upon the one, &rsquo;tis her as he will wed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill be a thing
to sharpen the claws of th&rsquo; old countess worse nor
ever&mdash;that marriage.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marion</span>.&nbsp; Ah, I reckon as her
be mortal angered with all the giddle-gaddle this business have
set up among the folk.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Regretfully</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never danced among the
trees myself.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marion</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Sadly</i>.]&nbsp;
Nor I, neither, Rose.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d dearly like
to be a countess, Marion.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marion</span>.&nbsp; His lordship might
think I was the maid.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m spry upon my feet you
know.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Susan</span> <i>comes still
nearer</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marion</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Turning to her
and speaking rudely</i>.]&nbsp; Well, Princess Rags,
&rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t likely as &rsquo;twas you a-dancing one of
your Morris dances in the wood that day!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Mockingly</i>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t likely as his
lordship would set his thoughts on a wench what could caper about
like a Morris man upon the high road.&nbsp; So there.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Indifferently</i>.]&nbsp; I never danced upon the high road,
I dances only where &rsquo;tis dark with gloom and no eyes upon
me.&nbsp; No mortal eyes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marion</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Impudently</i>.]&nbsp; Get along with you, Princess
Royal.&nbsp; Go off to th&rsquo; old gipsy Gran&rsquo;ma
yonder.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t want the likes of you along of
us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Go off and dance to
your own animals, Miss Goatherd.&nbsp; All of us be a-going to
practise our steps against May Day.&nbsp; Come along girls.</p>
<p>[<i>She signs to the other girls who all draw near and arrange
themselves for a Country Dance</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Susan</span> <i>goes slowly towards her</i> <span
class="smcap">Grandmother</span> <i>and sits on the ground by her
side</i>, <i>looking sadly and wistfully at the
dancers</i>.&nbsp; <i>At the end of the dance</i>, <i>the girls
pick up their baskets and go off in different directions across
the green</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Susan</span> <i>and
her</i> <span class="smcap">Grandmother</span> <i>remain in their
places</i>.&nbsp; <i>The gipsy continues to smoke and</i> <span
class="smcap">Susan</span> <i>absently turns over the things in
her basket</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; They mock me in the
name they have fixed to me&mdash;Princess Royal.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span>.&nbsp; Let them
mock.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll bring the words back to them like
scorpions upon their tongues.</p>
<p>[<i>There is a little silence and then</i> <span
class="smcap">Susan</span> <i>begins to sing as though to
herself</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Singing</i>.]</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;As I walked out one May morning,<br />
So early in the Spring;<br />
I placed my back against the old garden gate,<br />
And I heard my true love sing.&rdquo; <a name="citation1"></a><a

<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span>.&nbsp; [<i>At the end
of the singing</i>.]&nbsp; It might be the blackcap a-warbling
all among of the branches.&nbsp; So it might.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; Ah, &rsquo;twas I that
was a-dancing in the shade of the woods that day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span>.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll
never look on the likes of you&mdash;that&rsquo;s sure enough, my
little wench.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; I wish he was a
goat-herd like myself&mdash;O that I do.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span>.&nbsp; Then there
wouldn&rsquo;t be no use in your wedding yourself with him as I
can see.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis himself,
not his riches that I want.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span>.&nbsp; You be speaking
foolishness.&nbsp; What do you know of him&mdash;what do us blind
worms know about the stars above we?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; I see&rsquo;d him pass
by upon his horse one day.&nbsp; All there was of him did shine
like the sun upon the water&mdash;I was very near dazed by the
brightness.&nbsp; So I was.</p>
<p>[<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Grandmother</span>
<i>continues to smoke in silence</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Softly</i>.]&nbsp;
And &rsquo;twas then I lost the heart within me to him.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Jockie</span> <i>runs up beating his
tabor</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Springing
up</i>.]&nbsp; Come, Jockie, I have a mind to dance a step or
two.&nbsp; [<i>Rubbing her eyes with the back of her
hands</i>.]&nbsp; Tears be for them as have idle times and not
for poor wenches what mind cattle and goats.&nbsp; Come, play me
my own music, Jock.&nbsp; And play it as I do like it best.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Jockie</span> <i>begins to play the tune
of</i> &ldquo;<i>Princess Royal</i>&rdquo; <i>and</i> <span

slowly by and stand watching</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Susan</span> <i>suddenly perceives them and throws
herself on the ground</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Jockie</span> <i>stops playing</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Millicent</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Fanning
herself</i>.]&nbsp; A wondrous bold dance, upon my
word&mdash;could it have been that which captivated my lord,
Alice?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>.&nbsp; O no, mistress.&nbsp;
His lordship has no fancy for boldness in a maid.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Millicent</span>.&nbsp; Immodest
too.&nbsp; A Morris dance.&nbsp; The girl should hide her face in
shame.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>.&nbsp; And there she is,
looking at your ladyship with her gipsy eyes, bold as a brass
farthing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Starting up and
speaking passionately</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not be taunted for
my dancing&mdash;I likes to dance wild, and leap with my body
when my spirit leaps, and fly with my limbs when my heart flies
and move in the air same as the birds do move when &rsquo;tis
mating time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span>.&nbsp; Ah, &rsquo;tis
so with she.&nbsp; She baint no tame mouse what creeps from its
hole along of t&rsquo;others and who do go shuffle shuffle, in
and out of the ring, mild as milk and naught in the innards of
they but the squeak.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Defiantly</i>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas my dance gained his
lordship&rsquo;s praise&mdash;so there, fine madam.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Millicent</span>.&nbsp; Your
dance?&nbsp; Who are you then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>.&nbsp; A gipsy wench,
mistress, who minds the goats and pigs for one of they great
farms.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span>.&nbsp; Have a care for
that tongue of yours, madam waiting maid.&nbsp; For I know how to
lay sommat upon it what you won&rsquo;t fancy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Millicent</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Coming up
to</i> <span class="smcap">Susan</span> <i>and laying her hand on
her arm</i>.]&nbsp; Now tell me your name, my girl.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; They call me Princess
Royal.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Millicent</span>.&nbsp; O that must
be in jest.&nbsp; Why, you are clothed in rags, poor thing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Shaking herself
free</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;d sooner wear my own rags nor the laces
which you have got upon you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Millicent</span>.&nbsp; Now why do
you say such a thing?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas in these
rags as I danced in the wood that day, and &rsquo;tis by these
rags as my lord will know me once more.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Millicent</span>.&nbsp; Listen, I
will cover you in silk and laces, Princess Royal.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>.&nbsp; Susan is the
maid&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want
none of your laces or silks.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Millicent</span>.&nbsp; And feed you
with poultry and cream and sweetmeats.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; I want naught but my
crust of bread.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Millicent</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
fill your hands with gold pieces.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span>.&nbsp; Do you hear
that, Sue?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Doggedly</i>.]&nbsp; I hear her well enough, Gran.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Millicent</span>.&nbsp; If
you&rsquo;ll teach me your dance against May Day.&nbsp; Then,
I&rsquo;ll clothe myself much after your fashion and dance upon
the green with the rest.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not learn
you my dance.&nbsp; Not for all the gold in the world.&nbsp; You
shan&rsquo;t go and take the only thing I have away from me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Millicent</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Angrily</i>.]&nbsp; Neither shall a little gipsy wretch like
you take my love from me.&nbsp; We were as good as promised to
each other at our christening.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t put
yourself out for the baggage, madam.&nbsp; His lordship would
never look on her.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span>.&nbsp; Gold, did you
say, mistress?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Millicent</span>.&nbsp; Gold?&nbsp; O
yes&mdash;an apron full of gold, and silver too.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span>.&nbsp; Do you hear
that, Susan?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Doggedly</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not do it for a King&rsquo;s
ransom.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span>.&nbsp; You will.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll do it for the sake of poor old Gran, what&rsquo;s
been father and mother to you&mdash;and what&rsquo;s gone
hungered and thirsty so that you might have bread and drink.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Distractedly</i>.]&nbsp; O I can never give him up.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span>.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll
never be yourn to give&mdash;Dance till your legs is off and
he&rsquo;ll have naught to say to a gipsy brat when &rsquo;tis
all finished.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>.&nbsp; Whilst my lady belongs
to his lordship&rsquo;s own class, &rsquo;tis but suitable as she
should be the one to wed with him&mdash;knowing the foreign
tongues and all, and playing so sweetly on her instruments.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a lady anyone would be proud to take before the
Court in London.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Susan</span> <i>turns away with a

the market for to buy him with.&nbsp; [<i>A silence</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span>.&nbsp; And I could do
with a pair of good shoes to my poor old feet come winter time
when &rsquo;tis snowing.&nbsp; [<i>Another silence</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span>.&nbsp; And
&rsquo;twould be good not to go to bed with the pain of hunger
within my lean old body&mdash;so &rsquo;twould.&nbsp; [<span
class="smcap">Susan</span> <i>turns round suddenly</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll do it,
Gran.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll do it for your sake.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis very
likely true what you do say, all of you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d but
dance my feet off for naught.&nbsp; When he came to look into my
gipsy eyes, &rsquo;twould all be over and done with.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Millicent</span>.&nbsp; Sensible
girl.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis time she
should see which way her bread was spread.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; Come, Jockie, come
ladies&mdash;come Gran&mdash;we&rsquo;ll be off to the quiet of
our own place where I can learn her ladyship the steps and
capers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Rising and
pointing to an advancing figure</i>.]&nbsp; You&rsquo;d best make
haste.&nbsp; The mice be a-running from their holes once
more&mdash;t&rsquo;wouldn&rsquo;t do for they to know aught about
this.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; Let us go quickly

<p><i>Groups of village girls are sitting or standing about on
the green</i>.&nbsp; <i>A dais has been put up at one end of
it</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marion</span>.&nbsp; How slow the time do
pass, this May Day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s while it
away with a song or two.</p>
<p>[<i>They all join in singing</i>.&nbsp; <i>At the end of the
song the gipsy comes slowly and painfully across the green</i>,
<i>casting black looks to right and to left</i>.&nbsp; <i>She is
followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Susan</span>, <i>who appears
weighed down by sadness</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Good afternoon,
Princess Royal Rags.&nbsp; Are we to see you cutting capers
before his lordship this afternoon?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marion</span>.&nbsp; Get along and hide
your bare feet behind the tree, Royal.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d be ashamed
to go without shoes if &rsquo;twas me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; O leave me
alone&mdash;you be worse nor a nest of waspes&mdash;that you
be.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Turning
fiercely round</i>.]&nbsp; Us&rsquo;ll smoke them out of their
holes one day&mdash;see if us do not.</p>
<p>[<i>They pass over to the tree where the</i> <span
class="smcap">Grandmother</span> <i>sits down and</i> <span
class="smcap">Susan</span> <i>crouches by her side</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Presently they are joined by</i> <span
class="smcap">Jockie</span>.&nbsp; <i>The girls sing a verse or
two of another song</i>, <i>and during this</i> <span
class="smcap">Lady Millicent</span>, <i>enveloped in a big
cloak</i>, <i>goes over to the tree</i>, <i>followed by</i> <span
class="smcap">Alice</span>, <i>also wearing a long cloak and they
sit down by the side of</i> <span class="smcap">Susan</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marion</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Pointing</i>.]&nbsp; Who are those yonder, Rose?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I
don&rsquo;t know, Marion&mdash;strangers, may be.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marion</span>.&nbsp; O my heart goes wild
this afternoon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Mine too.&nbsp; Look,
there they come.</p>
<p>[<i>The Music begins to play and old</i> <span
class="smcap">Lady Cullen</span>, <i>followed by her lady
companions</i>, <i>comes slowly towards the dais</i>, <i>on which
she seats herself</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Cullen</span>.&nbsp; Dear me, what a
gathering to be sure.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Her Lady</span>.&nbsp; Indeed it is an
unusual sight.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Cullen</span>.&nbsp; And O what a sad
infatuation on the part of my poor boy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Her Lady</span>.&nbsp; The war has been
known to turn many a brain.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Cullen</span>.&nbsp; And yet my son
holds his own with the brightest intelligences of the day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Her Lady</span>.&nbsp; Only one little
spot of his lordship&rsquo;s brain seems to be affected.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Cullen</span>.&nbsp; Just so.&nbsp;
But here he comes, poor misguided youth.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Lord Cullen</span> <i>comes slowly over
the green</i>, <i>looking to right and to left</i>.&nbsp; <i>He
mounts the dais and sits down by his mother</i>, <i>and the music
plays for a country dance</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>The Twenty Ninth
of May</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>The girls arrange themselves</i>,
<i>and during the dance</i> <span class="smcap">Lord
Cullen</span> <i>scans each face very eagerly</i>.&nbsp; <i>The
dance ends and the girls pass in single file before the
dais</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Cullen</span>.&nbsp; No,
no&mdash;that was not the music of it, that was not the
dance&mdash;not a face among them resembles the image I carry in
my heart.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Cullen</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Aside</i>.]&nbsp; Thank goodness.&nbsp; May that face never
be seen again.</p>
<p>[<i>A fresh group come up and another dance is formed and
danced</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Cullen</span>.&nbsp; [<i>At the end
of it</i>.]&nbsp; Worse and worse.&nbsp; Could I have dreamed
both the music and the dance and the dancer?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Cullen</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Soothingly</i>.]&nbsp; I am sure this was the case, my dear
son.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Cullen</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Rallying</i>.]&nbsp; I heard her voice singing in the forest
before ever she began to dance.&nbsp; It was the sweetest voice
and song I ever heard.&nbsp; [<i>Looking around</i>.]&nbsp; Can
any of these maid, sing to me, I wonder?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marion</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Steps
forward</i>.]&nbsp; I only know one song, my lord.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Lord Cullen</span> <i>signs to her to
sing</i>, <i>and she stands before the dais and sings a verse
of</i> &ldquo;<i>Bedlam</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Cullen</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Impatiently</i>.]&nbsp; No, no&mdash;that is not in the least
what I remember.&nbsp; [<i>Turning to</i> <span
class="smcap">Rose</span>.]&nbsp; You try now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t sing, my
lord&mdash;but&mdash;[<i>Indicating another girl in the
group</i>] she has a sweet voice, and she knows a powerful lot of
songs.</p>
<p>[<i>A girl steps out from the others and sings a verse of</i>
&ldquo;<i>The Lark in the Morn</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Cullen</span>.&nbsp; Not that.&nbsp;
Mine was a song to stir the depths of a man&rsquo;s heart and
bring tears up from the fountains of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Cullen</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Eagerly</i>.]&nbsp; I seem to know that russet
skirt&mdash;those bare, small feet.&nbsp; [<i>Standing up
quickly</i>.]&nbsp; Mother, look at that maid with the red
kerchief on her head.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Cullen</span>.&nbsp; Some sort of a
gipsy dress, to all appearance.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Cullen</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Doubtfully</i>.]&nbsp; The skirt she wore was torn and
ragged&mdash;that day in the forest.&nbsp; She had no gold rings
to her ears, nor silken scarf upon her head&mdash;But this might
be her dress for holidays.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Jockie</span> <i>advances and begins to
play the tune of</i> &ldquo;<i>Princess Royal</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Cullen</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Eagerly</i>.]&nbsp; That is the right music&mdash;O is it
possible my quest is ended!</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Lady Millicent</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Alice</span>, <i>standing opposite one to another
begin to dance&mdash;slowly and clumsily</i>, <i>and in evident
doubt as to their steps</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Lord
Cullen</span> <i>watches them for a moment and then claps his
hands angrily as a sign for the music to stop</i>.&nbsp; <i>The
dancers pause</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Cullen</span>.&nbsp; This is a sad
mimicry of my beautiful love.&nbsp; But there lies something
behind the masquerade which I shall probe.</p>
<p>[<i>He leaves the dais and goes straight towards</i> <span
class="smcap">Lady Millicent</span>, <i>who turns from him in
confusion</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Cullen</span>.&nbsp; From whom did
you take the manner and the colour of your garments, my maid?</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Lady Millicent</span> <i>remains
obstinately silent</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Cullen</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Alice</span>.]&nbsp; Perhaps you have a tongue in
your head.&nbsp; From whom did you try to learn those steps?</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Alice</span> <i>turns sulkily
away</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Jockie</span> <i>comes
forward</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jockie</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell your
lordship all about it, and I&rsquo;ll take your lordship straight
to the right wench, that I will, if so be as your lordship will
give a shilling to a poor little swine-herd what goes empty and
hungered most of the year round.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Cullen</span>.&nbsp; A handful of
gold, my boy, if you lead me rightly.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Jockie</span> <i>leads the way to the
tree where</i> <span class="smcap">Susan</span> <i>is
sitting</i>.&nbsp; <i>She stands up as</i> <span
class="smcap">Lord Cullen</span> <i>approaches</i>, <i>and for a
moment they gaze at one another in silence</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span>.&nbsp; You might
curtsey to the gentleman, Susan.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Cullen</span>.&nbsp;
No&mdash;there&rsquo;s no need of that, from her to me.&nbsp;
[<i>Turning to</i> <span class="smcap">Jockie</span> <i>and
putting his hand in his pocket</i>.]&nbsp; Here, my boy, is a
golden pound for you&mdash;and more shall follow later.</p>
<p>[<i>He then takes</i> <span class="smcap">Susan&rsquo;s</span>
<i>hand and leads her to the foot of the dais</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Cullen</span>.&nbsp; Will you dance
for me again, Susan?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Several of the Girls</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Mockingly</i>.]&nbsp; Princess Royal is her name.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marion</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Rudely</i>.]&nbsp; Or Princess Rags.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis all took
out of my hands now, I can but do as your lordship says.&nbsp;
Jockie, play me my music, and play it bravely too.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Jockie</span> <i>places himself near her
and begins to play</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Susan</span>
<i>dances by herself</i>.&nbsp; <i>At the end of her dance</i>
<span class="smcap">Lord Cullen</span> <i>leads the applause</i>,
<i>and even the ladies on the dais join faintly in it</i>.&nbsp;
<i>He then takes</i> <span class="smcap">Susan</span> <i>by the
hand and mounts the dais with her and presents her to his
mother</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Cullen</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Aside</i>,
<i>to her companion</i>.]&nbsp; I wonder if the young person
understands that my poor boy is a little touched in the
brain?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Cullen</span>.&nbsp; Here is your
daughter, mother.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Lady Cullen</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Susan</span> <i>look at one another in
silence</i>.&nbsp; <i>After a moment</i> <span
class="smcap">Susan</span> <i>turns to</i> <span
class="smcap">Lord Cullen</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a poor
ragged thing to be daughter to the likes of she.&nbsp; But the
heart within of me is grander nor that of any queen, because of
the love that it holds for you, my lord.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Lord Cullen</span> <i>takes her hand and
leads her to the front of the dais</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Cullen</span>.&nbsp; We will be
married to-morrow, my princess.&nbsp; And all these good people
shall dance at our wedding.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marion</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Springing
up</i>.]&nbsp; And we&rsquo;ll do a bit of dancing now as
well.&nbsp; Come, Jockie, give us the tune of &ldquo;Haste to the
Wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it.&nbsp;
Come girls&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Millicent</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Alice</span>.]&nbsp; I pray he won&rsquo;t
find out about me.</p>
<p>[<i>The old</i> <span class="smcap">Grandmother</span> <i>has
come slowly towards the middle of the green</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother</span>.&nbsp; Ah, and my
little wench will know how to pay back some of the vipers tongues
which slandered her, when she sits on her velvet chair as a
countess, the diamonds a-trickling from her neck and the rubies
a-crowning of her head.&nbsp; Her&rsquo;ll not forget the snakes
what did lie in the grass.&nbsp; Her&rsquo;ll have her heel upon
they, so that their heads be put low and there shan&rsquo;t go no
more venom from their great jaws to harm she, my pretty
lamb&mdash;my little turtle.</p>
<p>[<i>The music begins to play and all those on the green form
themselves for the dance</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Lord
Cullen</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Susan</span>
<i>stand side by side in front of the dais</i>, <i>and the</i>
<span class="smcap">Grandmother</span> <i>lights a pipe and
smokes it as she watches the dance from below</i>.&nbsp; <i>At
the end of the dance</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Cullen</span>,

from the dais and</i>, <i>followed by</i> <span

between two lines of girls and so off the stage</i>.&nbsp; <i>The
girls follow in procession</i>, <i>and lastly the</i> <span

are rough seats in the porch and in front of the
window</i>.&nbsp; <i>Bunches of leaves and herbs hang drying

I gathered them up in the morning so soon.<br />

<p>[<span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>comes out of the

the dress of a farm labourer and carries a scythe over his

wearily down on the bench beneath the window</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Coming to the

<p class="poetry">&ldquo;For the grass that has oftentimes been
trampled underfoot,<br />
Give it time, it will rise up again.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking up
gloomily</i>.]&nbsp; And that it won&rsquo;t, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Suddenly perceiving
him and coming out</i>.]&nbsp; O you are fair spent from
journeying.&nbsp; Can I do anything for you, master?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Gazing at her
fixedly</i>.]&nbsp; You speak kindly for a stranger, but
&rsquo;tis beyond the power of you nor anyone to do aught for
me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Sitting down beside
him and pointing to the wall of the house</i>.]&nbsp; See those
leaves and flowers drying in the sun?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
medicine for every sort of sickness there, sir.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not a
root nor yet a herb on the face of the earth that could cure the
sickness I have within me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; That must be a terrible
sort of a sickness, master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; So &rsquo;tis.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis love.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Love?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; Yes, love; wicked,
unhappy love.&nbsp; Love what played false when riches
fled.&nbsp; Love that has given the heart what was all mine to
another.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Isabel</span> <i>has been slowly
approaching</i>, <i>she wears a cotton handkerchief over her head
and carries a small bundle tied up in a cloth on her
arm</i>.&nbsp; <i>Her movements are languid and sad</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; I know of flowers that
can heal even the pains of love.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Coming forward
and speaking earnestly</i>.]&nbsp; O tell me of them quickly,
mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Why, are you sick of
the same complaint?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Sinking down on
the grass at</i> <span class="smcap">Mary&rsquo;s</span>
<i>feet</i>.]&nbsp; So bruised and wounded in the heart that the
road from Framilode up here might well have been a hundred miles
or more.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; Framilode?&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis there you come from?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; I was servant at the
inn down yonder.&nbsp; Close upon the ferry.&nbsp; Do you know
the place, master?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; [<i>In deep
gloom</i>.]&nbsp; Ah, the place and the ferry man too.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Leaning forward and
clasping her hands</i>.]&nbsp; Him as is there to-day, or him who
was?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; He who was there and
left for foreign parts a good three year ago.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Isabel</span> <i>covers her face and is
shaken by sobs</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Lubin</span>
<i>leans his elbow on his knee</i>, <i>shading his eyes with his
hand</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; I have help for all
torments in my flowers.&nbsp; Such things be given us for
that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking
up</i>.]&nbsp; You be gentle in your voices mistress.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis like when a quist do sing, as you speaks.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Then do both of you
tell your sorrow.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill be strange if I do not find
sommat that will lighten your burdens for you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas at Moat
Farm I was born and bred.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Close up to Daniels
yonder?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; The same.&nbsp;
Rose-Anna of the Mill and I&mdash;we courted and was like to
marry.&nbsp; But there came misfortune and I lost my all.&nbsp;
She would not take a poor man, so I left these parts and got to
be what you do see me now&mdash;just a day labourer.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; Mine, &rsquo;tis the
same tale, very nigh.&nbsp; Robert the ferry-man and me, we loved
and was to have got us wedded, only there came a powerful rich
gentleman what used to go fishing along of Robert.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twas he that &rsquo;ticed my lover off to foreign
parts.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; [<i>With a heavy
sigh</i>.]&nbsp; These things are almost more than I can
bear.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; At first he wrote his
letters very often.&nbsp; Then &rsquo;twas seldom like.&nbsp;
Then &rsquo;twas never.&nbsp; And then there comed a
day&mdash;[<i>She is interrupted by her weeping</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Try to get out your
story&mdash;you can let the tears run afterwards if you have a
mind.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; There comed a day
when I did meet a fisherman from Bristol.&nbsp; He brought me
news of Robert back from the seas, clothed in fine stuff with
money in the pockets of him, horse and carriage, and just about
to wed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; Did he name the
maid?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; Rose-Anna she was
called, of Daniel&rsquo;s mill up yonder.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; Rose-Anna&mdash;She
with whom I was to have gone to church.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Here is a tangle worse
nor any briar rose.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; O &rsquo;twas such
beautiful times as we did have down by the riverside, him and
me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; She would sit, her
hand in mine by the hour of a Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>[<i>A pause during which</i> <span class="smcap">Lubin</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Isabel</span> <i>seem lost in
their own sad memories</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Mary</span>
<i>gets up softly and goes within the cottage</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; And when I heared as
&rsquo;twas to-morrow they were to wed, though &rsquo;twas like
driving a knife deeper within the heart of me, I up and got me
upon the road and did travel along by starlight and dawn and day
just for one look upon his face again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas so with
me.&nbsp; From beyond Oxford town I am come to hurt myself worse
than ever, by one sight of the eyes that have looked so cruel
false into mine.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; If I was to plead
upon my knees to him &rsquo;twould do no good&mdash;poor wench of
a serving maid like me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking down at
himself</i>.]&nbsp; She&rsquo;d spurn me from the door were I to
stand there knocking&mdash;in the coat I have upon me now.&nbsp;
No&mdash;let her go her way and wed her fancy man.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Lubin</span> <i>shades his eyes with one
hand</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Isabel</span> <i>bows her
head on her knees weeping</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>comes out of the house carrying two
glass bowls of water</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Leave your sorrowful
tears till later, my friends.&nbsp; This fresh water from the
spring will revive you from your travelling.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking
up</i>.]&nbsp; The heart of me is stricken past all remedy,
mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; I could well lie me
down and die.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>giving to each one a bowl
from which they begin to drink slowly</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; I spoke as you do,
once.&nbsp; My lover passed me by for another.&nbsp; A man may
give all his love to the gilly flower, but &rsquo;tis the scarlet
rose as takes his fancy come to-morrow.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; And has your heart
recovered from its sickness, mistress?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Slowly</i>.]&nbsp;
After many years.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; And could you wed you
to another?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Still more
slowly</i>.]&nbsp; Give the grass that has been trampled
underfoot a bit of time, &rsquo;twill rise again.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s healing all around of us for every ill, did we but
know it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d give sommat
to know where &rsquo;tis then.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; There isn&rsquo;t a
herb nor a leaf but what carries its message to them that are in
pain.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; Give me a bloom
that&rsquo;ll put me to sleep for always, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s evil
plants as well, but &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t a many.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s hen bane which do kill the fowls and fishes if they
eat the seed of it.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s water hemlock which
lays dumbness upon man.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard them
tell of that, I have.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; And of the good leaves
there is hounds tongue.&nbsp; Wear it at the feet of you against
dogs what be savage.&nbsp; Herb Benet you nail upon the
door.&nbsp; No witch nor evil thing can enter to your house.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; And have you naught
that can deaden the stab of love upon the heart, mistress?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Speaking in
anguish</i>.]&nbsp; Aught that can turn our faithless lovers back
again to we?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; That I have.&nbsp; See
these small packages&mdash;you that love Robert, take you
this&mdash;and you who courted Rose-Anna, stretch out your
hand.</p>
<p>[<i>She puts a small paper packet into the hands of
each</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking
uncertainly at his packet</i>.]&nbsp; What&rsquo;ll this do for
me, I&rsquo;d like to know?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis an unfailing
charm.&nbsp; A powder from roses, fine as dust, and another seed
as well.&nbsp; You put it in her glass of water&mdash;and the
love comes back to you afore next sun-rise.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; And will it be the
same with I?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; You have the Herb of
Robert there.&nbsp; Be careful of it.&nbsp; To-morrow at this
hour, his heart will be all yours again, and you shall do what
you will with it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; O I can&rsquo;t
believe in this.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis too good to be true, and that
it be&mdash;A fine gentleman as Robert be now and a poor little
wretch like me!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Slowly</i>.]&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis but a foolish dream like.&nbsp; How are folks like us
to get mixing and messing with the drinks of they?&nbsp; Time was
when I did sit and eat along of them at the table, the same as
one of theirselves.&nbsp; But now!&nbsp; Why, they&rsquo;d take
and hound me away from the door.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; And me too.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Breaking off a
spray of the enchanters nightshade from the bunch
drying</i>.]&nbsp; That&rsquo;ll bring luck, may be.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Isabel</span> <i>takes it and puts it in
her dress and then wraps the packet in her bundle</i>.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Lubin</span> <i>puts his packet away
also</i>.&nbsp; <i>Whilst they are doing this</i>, <span
class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>strolls a little way on the
road</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Returning</i>.]&nbsp; The man from Daniels be coming
along.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Hastily</i>.]&nbsp; What, old Andrews?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; This is
another.&nbsp; Folk do marvel how Miller John do have the
patience to keep in with him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; How&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; So slow and heavy in
his ways.&nbsp; But he can drink longer at the cider than any man
in the county afore it do fly to his head, and that&rsquo;s why
master do put up with him.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Jeremy</span> <i>comes heavily towards
them</i>, <i>a straw in his mouth</i>.&nbsp; <i>His hat is pushed
to the back of his head</i>.&nbsp; <i>His expression is still and

<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking coldly

away&mdash;off afore dawn to the Fair and took their clothes
along of they.&nbsp; I be left with all upon me like, and
&rsquo;tis too much.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; What shall you do,
Jerry?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be blowed
if I&rsquo;m agoin&rsquo; to do anything.&nbsp; There.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;ll have
to stir yourself up and deck the house and set the table and wait
upon the visitors and look to the traps and horses and all,
Jerry&mdash;seeing as you&rsquo;re the only one.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not one as steps beyond my own work, and master do know
it too.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Then how are they going
to manage?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m out to find
them as&rsquo;ll manage for them.&nbsp; [<i>Turning sharply

<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Faintly</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve gone from the place where I
was servant.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; Then you&rsquo;ll
come along of me&mdash;the both of you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Shrinking</i>.]&nbsp; O no&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t go
among&mdash;among strangers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; I never takes no
count of a female&rsquo;s vapours.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll come along
of me.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll curl the mistress&rsquo;s hair and lace
her gown and keep her tongue quiet&mdash;and you [<i>turning
to</i> <span class="smcap">Lubin</span>] my man, will set the
tables and wait upon the quality what we expect from Bristol town
this dinner-time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Angrily</i>.]&nbsp; I never waited on man nor woman in my
life, and I&rsquo;ll not start now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; You will.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not agoin&rsquo; a half mile further this warm
morning.&nbsp; Back to the Mill you goes along of me, the two of
you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking fixedly
at</i> <span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.]&nbsp; This is a chance
for you, my dear.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll not find a better.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; Better?&nbsp; I count
as you&rsquo;ll not better this&rsquo;n.&nbsp; Good money for
your pains&mdash;victuals to stuff you proper, and cider, all you
can drink on a summer&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; I count you&rsquo;ll not
better that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; [<i>As though to
himself</i>.]&nbsp; I could not go.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; Some cattle want a

<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Timidly to</i>
<span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.]&nbsp; If I go, could not you
try and come along with me, master?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll never

<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a fine fat

fancies into the head of her.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span

drop of cider down at the Red Bull.&nbsp; Mayhap you&rsquo;ll be

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll see that

<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; [<i>In

<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Impassively</i>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis of no account, us&rsquo;ll
call you William like the last one.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; O, and couldn&rsquo;t
I be called like the last one too?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; Then us&rsquo;ll call
you Lucy.&nbsp; And a rare bad slut her was, and doubtless
you&rsquo;ll not prove much worser.</p>
<p>[<i>He goes away</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; This is your

<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll know the
both of us.&nbsp; Love isn&rsquo;t never quite so dead but what a
sound in the speech or a movement of the hand will bring some
breath to it again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re right
there, master&mdash;sommat&rsquo;ll stir in the hearts of them
when they sees we&mdash;and &rsquo;tis from the door as
us&rsquo;ll be chased for masking on them like this.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; But not before the
seeds of love have done their work.&nbsp; Come, Isabel; come,
Lubin&mdash;I will so dress you that you shall not be
recognised.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>goes indoors</i>.&nbsp;

her bundle</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Lubin</span> <i>remains
seated</i>, <i>looking gloomily before him</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; Come, think what
&rsquo;twill feel to be along of our dear loves and look upon the
forms of them and hear the notes of their voices once again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I am

<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll gladly
bear the pain.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; [<i>After a
pause</i>.]&nbsp; Then so will I.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll go.</p>

<h3>ACT II.&mdash;Scene 1.</h3>
<p><i>The living room at Daniel&rsquo;s Mill</i>.&nbsp; <i>In the
window</i> <span class="smcap">Rose-Anna</span> <i>is seated
awkwardly sewing some bright ribbons on to a muslin
gown</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Kitty</span> <i>is moving
about rapidly dusting chairs and ornaments which are in disorder
about the room and</i> <span class="smcap">John</span> <i>stands
with his back to the grate gravely surveying them</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Petulantly</i>.]&nbsp; Whatever shall we do, John!&nbsp; Me
not dressed, everything no how, and them expected in less nor a
half hour&rsquo;s time?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; There!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve finished a-dusting the chairs.&nbsp; Now I&rsquo;ll
set them in their places.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; No one is thinking of
me!&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s going to help me on with my gown and curl
my hair like Robert was used to seeing me wear it at
Aunt&rsquo;s?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; Did you have it
different down at Bristol, Rose?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Of course I did.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t do to be countrified in the town.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Your hair&rsquo;s well
enough like that.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t of hair as
anyone&rsquo;ll be thinking when they comes in, but of
victuals.&nbsp; And how we&rsquo;re a-going to get the table and
all fixed up in so short a time do fairly puzzle me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll do the
table.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve
got to help me with my gown.&nbsp; O that was a good-for-nothing
baggage, leaving us in the lurch!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ve done
my best to get us out of the fix.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; And what would that be,
pray?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; Why John, you&rsquo;ve
done nothing but stand with your back to the grate this last
hour.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve sent off
Jerry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Scornfully</i>.]&nbsp; Much good that&rsquo;ll do.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; We know just how far
Jerry will have gone.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; I told him not to shew
hisself unless he could bring a couple of servants back along
with him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Angrily</i>.]&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re more foolish than I took you to be, John.&nbsp; Get
you off at once and fetch Jerry from his cider at the Red
Bull.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s not much of a hand about the house, but
he&rsquo;s better than no one.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Sighing
heavily</i>.]&nbsp; Jeremy&rsquo;s not the man to start his
drinking so early in the day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve caught him
at the cask soon after dawn.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; And so have I,
John.&nbsp; How you put up with his independent ways I
don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Ah, &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t
everyone as has such a powerful strong head as
Jerry&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s one that can be trusted to take
his fill, and none the worse with him afterwards.</p>
<p>[<i>A knock at the door</i>, <i>which is pushed open by</i>
<span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; [<i>From the
doorway</i>.]&nbsp; Well, Master John&mdash;well, mistress?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Sharply</i>.]&nbsp;
Master was just starting out for to fetch you home, Jerry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Ignoring
her</i>.]&nbsp; Well, master, I&rsquo;ve brought a couple back
along of me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Ducklings or
chickens?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve gotten
them too.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; Do you mean that
you&rsquo;ve found some servants for us, Jerry?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; Two outside.&nbsp;
Female and male.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t I tell you
so!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s naught that Jerry cannot do.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll have a drink for this, my man</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; You may take my word
he&rsquo;s had that already, John.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; I have,
mistress.&nbsp; Whilst they was a packing up the poultry in my
basket.&nbsp; Down at the Bull.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; What sort of a maid is
it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; Ah, &rsquo;tis for
you to tell me that, mistress, when you&rsquo;ve had her along of
you a bit.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; And the man?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; Much the same as any
other male.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Impatiently</i>.]&nbsp; Do you step outside, John, and have a
look at them, and if they&rsquo;re suitable bring them in and
we&rsquo;ll set them about their work.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>goes out</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Kitty</span> <i>peers through the window</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; I reckon I can go off
and feed the hilts now.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Feed the hilts!&nbsp;
Indeed you can&rsquo;t do no such thing.&nbsp; O I&rsquo;m mad
with vexation that nothing is well ordered or suitably prepared
for Mr. Robert and his fine cousins from Bristol town.&nbsp;
Whatever will they say to such a house when they do see it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I
don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; [<i>From the
window</i>.]&nbsp; I see the new servants.&nbsp; John is bringing
them up the walk.&nbsp; The man&rsquo;s face is hid by his broad
hat, but the girl looks neat enough in her cotton gown and
sun-bonnet.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>comes into the room</i>,
<i>followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Lubin</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Lubin</span> <i>shuffles off his hat</i>, <i>but
holds it between his face and the people in the room</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Pointing to them
and speaking to</i> <span class="smcap">Rose</span>.]&nbsp; There
you are, mistress&mdash;man-servant and maid.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; What do we know about
them?&nbsp; Folk picked up by Jerry at the Red Bull.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; No, from the
roadside.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Worser far.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; No, no, Rose.&nbsp;
These young persons were spoken for by Mary Meadows.&nbsp; And
&rsquo;tis rare fortunate for we to obtain their services at
short notice like this.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Isabel</span>.]&nbsp; What are you called, my
girl?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Faintly</i>.]&nbsp; Isabel is my name, but I&rsquo;d sooner
you called me Lucy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; And that I will.&nbsp;
My tongue is used to Lucy.&nbsp; The other is a flighty, fanciful
name for a servant.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; And what is the man
called, John?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Harshly</i>.]&nbsp; I am called William.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; William and
Lucy!&nbsp; Like the ones that ran away this morning.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; O do not let us waste
any more time!&nbsp; Jerry, do you take the man and shew him his
work in the back kitchen; and Lucy, come to me and help me with
my gown and my hair dressing.&nbsp; We have not a minute to
lose.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; They may be upon us
any time now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go out and gather the flowers for
the parlour, since you don&rsquo;t want me any more within,
Rose.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll get and
finish Jeremy&rsquo;s work in the yard.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis upside
down and round about and no how to-day.&nbsp; But we&rsquo;ll
come out of it some time afore next year I reckon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you ever
go for to get married, master.&nbsp; There could never come a
worser caddle into a man&rsquo;s days nor matrimony, I count.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">John</span>, <i>on his way to the
door</i>, <i>pauses&mdash;as though momentarily lost in
thought</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Was Mary Meadows asked
to drop in at any time to-day, Rose?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Who is taking up
her gown and ribbons to show to</i> <span
class="smcap">Isabel</span>, <i>and speaking crossly</i>.]&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know, nor care.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
enough to think about as &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking</i> <span
class="smcap">John&rsquo;s</span> <i>arm playfully</i>.]&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re terribly took up with Mary Meadows, John.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; There isn&rsquo;t many
like her, Kitty.&nbsp; She do rear herself above t&rsquo;others
as&mdash;as a good wheat stalk from out the rubbish.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Kitty</span> <i>go slowly out</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; [<i>As though to
himself</i>.]&nbsp; I sees as how I shall have to keep an eye on
master&mdash;[<i>turning to</i> <span class="smcap">Lubin</span>
<i>and signing to him</i>.]&nbsp; But come, my man, us has no
time for romance, &rsquo;tis dish washing as lies afore you
now.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Lubin</span> <i>jerks his head haughtily
and makes a protesting gesture</i>.&nbsp; <i>Then he seems to
remember himself and follows</i> <span
class="smcap">Jeremy</span> <i>humbly from the room</i>.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Rose</span> <i>takes up some ribbons and
laces</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Isabel</span>, <i>who is standing near</i>.]&nbsp;
Now, Lucy, we must look sharp; Mister Robert and his cousins from
Bristol town will soon be here.&nbsp; I have not met with the
cousins yet, but I&rsquo;ve been told as they&rsquo;re very fine
ladies&mdash;They stood in place of parents to my Robert, you
know.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis unfortunate we should be in such a sad
muddle the day they come.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; When I have helped
you into your gown, mistress, I shall soon have the dinner spread
and all in order.&nbsp; I be used to such work, and I&rsquo;m
considered spry upon my feet.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis more serious
that you should be able to curl my hair in the way that Mr.
Robert likes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Sadly</i>.]&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t doubt but that I shall be able to do that too,
mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Very well.&nbsp; Take
the gown and come with me up to my room.</p>
<p>[<i>They go out together</i>, <span

<p><i>The same room</i>.&nbsp; <i>The table is laid for dinner

upon it</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Lubin</span> <i>wearing

it, Master Lubin?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Bitterly</i>.]&nbsp; Do not you &ldquo;Master&rdquo; me,
Isabel.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m only a common servant in the house where
once I was lover and almost brother.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Coming up to
him</i>.]&nbsp; O do not take it so hard, Lubin&mdash;Us can do
naught at this pass but trust what the young woman did tell
me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Gloomily</i>.]&nbsp; The sight of Rose has stirred up my love
so powerful that I do hardly know how to hold the tears back from
my eyes.</p>

with her apron</i>.]&nbsp; What&rsquo;ll it be for me when Robert
comes in?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll have to
help one another, Isabel, in the plight where we stand.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
it.&nbsp; And perchance as them seeds&rsquo;ll do the rest.</p>
<p>[<i>They spring apart as a sound of voices and laughter is
heard outside</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Runs
in</i>.]&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve come.&nbsp; All of them.&nbsp; And
do you know that Robert&rsquo;s cousins are no fine ladies at
all, as he said, but just two common old women dressed
grand-like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; That will be a sad
shock to poor mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; O, she is too much
taken up with Mister Robert to notice yet.&nbsp; But quick!&nbsp;
They are all sharp set from the drive.&nbsp; Fetch in the dishes,
William and Lucy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; All shall be ready in
a moment, Miss Kitty.</p>
<p>[<i>She goes hurriedly out followed by</i> <span

count as that there old-fashioned grate do take a rare bit of

<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Very pleasant
indeed.&nbsp; But I didn&rsquo;t reckon as the room would be
quite the shape as &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; Come to that, I
didn&rsquo;t expect the house to look as it do.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Very ancient in

<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking at her

something.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Putting her hand to
her head</i>.]&nbsp; The new maid.&nbsp; A stupid country
wench.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got my
meaning wrong.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis that I&rsquo;ve never seen you
look so well before.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; O dear Robert!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got my
fancy more than ever, Rose.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; O, I&rsquo;m so happy
to be going off with you to-morrow, and I love it down at
Bristol.&nbsp; Robert, I&rsquo;m tired and sick of country
life.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll make a
grand fine lady of you there, Rose.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>A little
sharply</i>.]&nbsp; Am I not one in looks already, Robert?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re what I
do dote upon.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t say no more.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Lubin</span> <i>and</i> <span

out into the garden</i>.&nbsp; <i>The staircase door is
opened</i>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Liz</span>, <span

class="smcap">Kitty</span> <i>come into the room</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Liz</span> <i>and</i> <span

violet and green ribbons</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll sit down,
now.&nbsp; John won&rsquo;t be a moment before he&rsquo;s
here.</p>
<p>[<i>She sits down at one end of the table and signs to</i>
<span class="smcap">Robert</span> <i>to place himself next to
her</i>.&nbsp; <i>The sisters and</i> <span

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
right.&nbsp; Everyone in their places?&nbsp; But no cover laid
for Mary?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Carelessly</i>.]&nbsp; We can soon have one put, should she
take it into her head to drop in.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it.&nbsp;
Now ladies, now Robert&mdash;&rsquo;tis thirsty work a-driving
upon the Bristol road at midsummer.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll lead off
with a drink of home-made cider.&nbsp; The eating&rsquo;ll come
sweeter afterwards.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it,
Miller.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Lubin</span> <i>and</i> <span

mugs from each place to the side table</i>, <i>where</i> <span

table</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span> [<i>Taking up a
spoon</i>.]&nbsp; Real plated, sister.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Upon my word, so
&rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; And not so bright as I
should wish to see it neither.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had a sad trouble
with my maids of late.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; Sister and I don&rsquo;t
keep none of them, thank goodness.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; We does our work with
our own hands.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d be ashamed if &rsquo;twas
otherwise.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Scowling at
them</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been and engaged a house-full of
servants for Rose-Anna.&nbsp; She shall know what &rsquo;tis to
live like a lady once she enters our family.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Servants be like green
fly on the bush.&nbsp; They do but spoil th&rsquo; home and
everything they do touch.&nbsp; All save one.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; And that one&rsquo;s
Jerry, I suppose.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re right
there, Kitty, that you are.&nbsp; A harder head was never given
to man than what Jerry do carry twixt his shoulders.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Lubin</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Isabel</span> <i>here put round the mugs of
cider</i>, <i>and everyone drinks thirstily</i>.&nbsp; <span

<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Setting down his

foreign parts.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking fondly at

one.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Carelessly
handing it to</i> <span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.]&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t mind if I do have another swill.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Isabel</span> <i>fills the mug and puts
it by his side</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; As good as any I ever
tasted.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t better
it at the King&rsquo;s Head up our way.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Good drink&mdash;plenty
of it.&nbsp; Now we&rsquo;ll start upon the meat I reckon.</p>
<p>[<i>He takes up a knife and fork and begins to carve</i>,

plates</i>.&nbsp; <i>During this</i> <span

about the room</i>, <i>finally fixing itself on</i> <span

back kitchen with plates</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; The new serving maid
you&rsquo;ve got there, Rose, should wear a cap and not her
bonnet.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; How sharp you are to
notice anything.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; A very pretty looking
wench, from what I can see.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Speaking more to
the cousins than to</i> <span class="smcap">Robert</span>.]&nbsp;
O she&rsquo;s but a rough and untrained girl got in all of a
hurry.&nbsp; Not at all the sort I&rsquo;ve been used to in this
house, I can tell you.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Isabel</span> <i>comes back with fresh
plates and stands at the side table</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Jane</span>.]&nbsp; A mellower piece of pig meat I
never did taste, sister.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry I went
and took the poultry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; John will carve you
some ham if you&rsquo;d like to try it, Miss Jane.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure
I&rsquo;m much obliged.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Jeremy</span> <i>comes in</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Coming to the
back of</i> <span class="smcap">Jane&rsquo;s</span>

what I says.&nbsp; Commence with ham and finish with he.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what do suit the inside of a delicate female.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking up
admiringly</i>.]&nbsp; Now that&rsquo;s just what old Uncle he
did used to say.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; Old uncle did know
what he was a-talking about then.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Warming and looking
less awkward and ill at ease</i>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas the gout
what kept Uncle so low in his eating, &rsquo;twas not th&rsquo;
inclination of him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; Ah
&rsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t be the gout nor any other disease as would
keep me from a platter of good food.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Nor from your mug of
drink neither, Jerry.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Jeremy</span> <i>laughs and moves off to
the side table</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; A very pleasant sort of
man.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; I do like anyone
what&rsquo;s homely.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Calling out
heartily</i>.]&nbsp; Do you listen to that, Jerry!&nbsp; The
ladies here do find you pleasant and homely, and I don&rsquo;t
know what else.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; The mugs want filling
once more.</p>
<p>[<i>He stolidly goes round the table refilling the
mugs</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Rose&rsquo;s</span> <i>gaze
wanders about her</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span

<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; Who?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Well&mdash;the new farm
hand.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; A sulky looking
brute.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d not let him wear his hat to table if I was
master here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; He puts me in mind
of&mdash;well&mdash;there, I can&rsquo;t recollect who
&rsquo;tis.&nbsp; [<i>A knock is heard at the door</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Sharply to</i>
<span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.]&nbsp; Go and see who
&rsquo;tis, Lucy.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Isabel</span> <i>opens the door</i>,
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mary Meadows</span> <i>stands on
the threshold</i>, <i>a large nosegay of beautiful wild flowers

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Rising up in great
pleasure</i>.]&nbsp; You&rsquo;re late, Mary.&nbsp; But
you&rsquo;re welcome as the&mdash;as the very sunshine.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Set another place,
Lucy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Not for me, Rose.&nbsp;
I did not come here to eat or drink, but to bring you these few
blossoms and my love.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Rises from the
table and takes the nosegay</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure
you&rsquo;re very kind, Mary&mdash;Suppose we were all to move
into the parlour now we have finished dinner, and then we could
enjoy a bit of conversation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; Very pleasant, I&rsquo;m
sure.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; I see no objection.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Running round to
look at the flowers</i>.]&nbsp; And Mary shall tell us how to
make charms out of the flowers&mdash;and the meanings of the
blossoms and all the strange things she knows about them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking a flower
from the bunch and putting it into his coat</i>.]&nbsp; Yes, and
how to brew tea as&rsquo;ll curl up anyone&rsquo;s tongue within
the mouth for a year&mdash;and fancy drinks for sheep with foot
rot, and powders against the murrain and any other nonsense that
you do please.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Now, John, I&rsquo;ll
not have you damage my business like this.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; Maybe as the young
person&rsquo;s got sommat what&rsquo;ll be handy with your
complaint, sister.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Or for when you be took
with th&rsquo; air in your head so bad, Jane.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Yes, I reckon that Mary
has a charm for every ill beneath the sun.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s go
off to the parlour along of her.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not coming
with us, John, are you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d not miss the
telling of these things for anything in the world, foolishness
though they be.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Come along
then&mdash;all of you.</p>
<p>[<i>They all go out</i>.&nbsp; <span

them</i>.&nbsp; <i>As she passes through it</i> <span

<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; We shall hope for your
company, too.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; To be sure, mister.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Haughtily</i>.]&nbsp; I bain&rsquo;t one for parlours, nor
charms, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; I be here for another purpose.</p>
<p>[<i>They leave the room</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Having watched
the party out</i>, <i>moves towards the cider jug</i>.]&nbsp;
Now, my man, now, my wench&mdash;us&rsquo;ll see what can be done
with the victuals and drink they&rsquo;ve been and left.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis a fair heavy feed and drink as I do need.&nbsp; Sommat
as&rsquo;ll lift me up through all the trials of this here
foolish matrimony and stuff.</p>

<h3>ACT III.&mdash;Scene 1.</h3>
<p><i>The next morning</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Robert&rsquo;s</span> <i>cousins are standing by
the fire-place of the same room</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis powerful
unhomely here, Jane.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; And that
&rsquo;tis.&nbsp; I wish as Robert had never brought us along of
him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a stuck-up
jay of a thing what he&rsquo;s about to wed if ever I seed
one.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; That her be.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ll live to wish hisself dead and buried one day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; There bain&rsquo;t but
one sensible tongue in the whole place to my mind.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Ah, he&rsquo;s a man to
anyone&rsquo;s liking, sister.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis homelike as
he do make I to feel among all these strangers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Here he comes.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Jeremy</span> <i>with a yoke and two
pails stands at the doorway</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; Now do you come in,
mister, and have a bit of talk along of we.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Set down them pails and
do as sister says, Mister Jeremy.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Jeremy</span> <i>looks them all over and
then slowly and deliberately sets down his pails</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right,
sister and me was feeling terribly lonesome here this
morning.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; And we was wishing as
we&rsquo;d never left home to come among all these stranger
folk.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; Not that we feels you to
be a stranger, dear Mister Jeremy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; You be a plain homely
man such as me and sister be accustomed to.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; Anything more?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; I suppose you&rsquo;ve
put by a tidy bit&mdash;seeing as you be of a certain age.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Although your looks
favour you well, don&rsquo;t they, sister?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; To be sure they do.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; And I reckon as you
could set up a home of your own any day, mister.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Pointing through
the window</i>.]&nbsp; See that there roof against the mill?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; Indeed I do.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s where I
do live.</p>
<p>[<i>Both sisters move quickly to the window</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; A very comfortable
looking home indeed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; I likes the looks of it
better nor this great old house.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Archly</i>.]&nbsp;
Now I daresay there&rsquo;s but one thing wanted over there,
Mister Jeremy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; A good wife to do and
manage for you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; I never was done for
nor managed by a female yet, and blowed if I will be now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Shaking her finger
at him</i>.]&nbsp; Sister an&rsquo; me knows what comes of such
words, don&rsquo;t us, sister?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis an old saying in
our family as one wedding do make a many.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; Give me a
woman&rsquo;s tongue for foolishness.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heared a
saying too in my family, which be&mdash;get a female on to your
hearth and &rsquo;tis Bedlam straight away.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Now, sister, did you
ever hear the like of that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; Us&rsquo;ll have to
change his mind for him, Jane.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; I reckon
&rsquo;twould take a rare lot of doing to change that,
mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Bain&rsquo;t you
a-goin&rsquo; to get yourself ready for church soon?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; Dashed if I ever
heard tell of such foolishness.&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s to mind the
place with all the folk gone fiddle-faddling out?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s the man
William.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; I bain&rsquo;t
a-goin&rsquo; to leave the place to a stranger.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Why, sister,
us&rsquo;ll feel lost and lonesome without mister, shan&rsquo;t
us, Liz?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; That us will.&nbsp; What
if us stayed at home and helped to mind the house along of
he?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Slowly</i>.]&nbsp;
And did not put our new gowns upon the backs of we after all the
money spent?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; Ah, there you
be.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the same with all females.&nbsp; Creatures
of vanity&mdash;even if they be got a bit long in the
tooth.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis all the same.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Jane</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Liz</span> <i>draw themselves up</i>,
<i>bridling</i>, <i>but</i> <span class="smcap">Liz</span>
<i>relaxes</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; He must have his little
joke, sister, man-like, you know.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>enters</i>.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Jerry, and I&rsquo;ve
been seeking you everywhere.&nbsp; Come you off to the
yard.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis as much as we shall do to be ready afore
church time.&nbsp; I never knew you to idle in the house
afore.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking up his
pails</i>, <i>sarcastically</i>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas the females
as tempted I, master, but &rsquo;twon&rsquo;t occur again, so
there.&nbsp; [<i>He hurries off</i>, <i>followed by</i> <span
class="smcap">John</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; [<i>With
dignity</i>.]&nbsp; Us&rsquo;ll go upstairs and dress,
sister.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis time we did
so.&nbsp; All them new-fashioned things be awkward in the
fastenings.</p>
<p>[<i>They go upstairs</i>.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Robert</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Rose</span> <i>come in from the garden</i>.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Robert</span> <i>carries a little card-board
box in his hand</i>, <i>which he places on the table</i>.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Rose</span> <i>sits down listlessly on a
chair leaning her arms on the table</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Undoing the
box</i>.]&nbsp; This is the bouquet what I promised to bring from
town.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Her gaze wandering
outside</i>.]&nbsp; Well, we might as well look at it afore I go
to dress.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Robert</span> <i>uncovers the box and
takes out a small bouquet of white flowers surrounded by a lace
frill</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking it from him
carelessly and raising it to her face</i>.]&nbsp; Why, they are
false ones.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Contemptuously</i>.]&nbsp; My good girl, who ever went to
church with orange blossom that was real, I&rsquo;d like to
know?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Languidly dropping
the bouquet on the table</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t
care.&nbsp; I reckon that one thing&rsquo;s about as good as
another to be married with.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Going to the
window and looking out</i>.]&nbsp; Ah&mdash;I daresay &rsquo;tis
so.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; I feel tired of my
wedding day already&mdash;that I do.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a
plaguey, fanciful kind of feel about the day, what a man&rsquo;s
hardly used to, so it seems to me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Wildly</i>.]&nbsp;
O, I reckon we may get used to it in time afore we die.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; Now&mdash;if
&rsquo;twas with the right&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Right what, Robert?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Confused</i>.]&nbsp; I hardly know what I was a-going to say,
Rose.&nbsp; Suppose you was to take up your flowers and go to
dress yourself.&nbsp; We might as well get it all over and
finished with.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Rising
slowly</i>.]&nbsp; Perhaps &rsquo;twould be best.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll go to my room, and you might call the girl Lucy and
send her up to help me with my things.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you take
the bouquet along of you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; No&mdash;let it bide
there.&nbsp; I can have it later.</p>
<p>[<i>She goes slowly from the room</i>.</p>
<p>[<i>Left to himself</i>, <span class="smcap">Robert</span>
<i>strolls to the open door and looks gloomily out on the
garden</i>.&nbsp; <i>Suddenly his face brightens</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; Lucy, Lucy, come you
in here a moment.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span>.&nbsp; [<i>From
outside</i>.]&nbsp; I be busy just now hanging out my cloths,
master.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; Leave your dish

Lucy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lucy</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Coming to the
door</i>.]&nbsp; Mistress wants me, did you say?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; Yes, you&rsquo;ve got
to go and dress her for the church.&nbsp; But you can spare me a
minute or two first.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Going quickly
across the room to the staircase door</i>.]&nbsp; Indeed, that is
what I cannot do, master.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis late already.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Catches her hand
and pulls her back</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never had a good look
at your face yet, my girl&mdash;you act uncommon coy, and that
you do.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Turning her head
away and speaking angrily</i>.]&nbsp; Let go of my hand, I tell
you.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want no nonsense of that sort.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; Lucy, your voice do
stir me in a very uncommon fashion, and there&rsquo;s sommat
about the appearance of you&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; Let go of me,
master.&nbsp; Suppose as anyone should look through the
window.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; Let them look.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d give a good bit for all the world to see us now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; O, whatever do you
mean by that, Mister Robert?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; What I say.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis with you as I&rsquo;d be going along to church this
morning.&nbsp; Not her what&rsquo;s above.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; But I wouldn&rsquo;t
go with you&mdash;No, not for all the gold in the world.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; Ah, you&rsquo;ve
changed since yesterday.&nbsp; When I caught your eye at dinner,
&rsquo;twas gentle as a dove&rsquo;s&mdash;and your hand, when it
gave me my mug of cider did seem&mdash;well did seem to put a
caress upon me like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; O there lies a world
of time twixt yesterday and to-day, Master Robert.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; So it do seem.&nbsp;
For to-day &rsquo;tis all thorns and thistles with you&mdash;But
I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; to have my look at your pretty face and
my kiss of it too.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; I shall scream out
loud if you touches me&mdash;that I shall.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Pulling her to
him</i>.]&nbsp; Us&rsquo;ll see about that.</p>
<p>[<i>He tries to get a sight of her face</i>, <i>but she twists
and turns</i>.&nbsp; <i>Finally he seizes both her hands and
covers them with kisses as</i> <span class="smcap">Kitty</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; O whatever&rsquo;s
going on!&nbsp; Rose, Rose, John&mdash;come you in here quickly,
do.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>.]&nbsp; O
you bad, wicked girl.&nbsp; I knew you couldn&rsquo;t be a very
nice servant brought in off the road by Jeremy.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Isabel</span>, <i>released by</i> <span

her disordered sun-bonnet and trying to hide her tears</i>.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Robert</span> <i>watches her
sullenly</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Goes to the
staircase door and calls loudly</i>.]&nbsp; Rose, Rose&mdash;come
you down as quick as you can run.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Coming
down</i>.]&nbsp; What&rsquo;s all this, I&rsquo;d like to
know?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s Lucy,
behaving dreadful&mdash;O you must send her straight away from
the house, Rose.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; What has she done,
then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; Going on with
Robert.&nbsp; Flirting, Rose, and kissing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; O no, mistress,
twasn&rsquo;t so, I do swear to you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Brutally</i>.]&nbsp; Yes &rsquo;twas.&nbsp; The maid so put
me powerful in mind of someone who&mdash;who&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Coldly</i>.]&nbsp;
I understand you, Robert.&nbsp; Well, &rsquo;tis lucky that all
this didn&rsquo;t come off an hour or so later.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Tearfully</i>.]&nbsp; O Rose, what do you mean?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; I mean that
what&rsquo;s not broken don&rsquo;t need no mending.&nbsp; Robert
can go to church with someone else to-day, he can.&nbsp; And no
harm done.</p>
<p>[<i>She takes up the bunch of orange flowers and begins
pulling it to pieces and throwing it all about the room</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; O Rose, Rose,
don&rsquo;t take it so hard.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t
Robert&rsquo;s fault.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas the girl off the road
what led him on.&nbsp; I know it.&nbsp; Tell her to get out of
the house.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll dress you&mdash;I&rsquo;ll do the
work.&nbsp; Only be just and sensible again; dear Rose.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Let the girl
bide.&nbsp; It makes no difference to me.&nbsp; There&rsquo;ll be
no marrying for me to-day.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>comes in at the
door</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Running to
him</i>.]&nbsp; O John, John&mdash;do you quiet down Rose and
tell her to get upstairs and dress.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a-saying
that she won&rsquo;t marry Robert because of his goings on with
the new servant&mdash;But, O, you&rsquo;ll talk her into reason
again, won&rsquo;t you, dear John?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Come, come,
what&rsquo;s all this cackle about, Rose?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m breaking off
with Robert, that&rsquo;s all, John.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Robert, can&rsquo;t you
take and explain a bit what &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Sullenly</i>.]&nbsp; A little bit of play &rsquo;twixt me and
the wench there, and that&rsquo;s about all, I reckon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Now that&rsquo;s an
unsensible sort of thing to get doing on your marriage day, to my
thinking.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t
Robert&rsquo;s fault, I know.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas the maid off the
road who started it.</p>
<p>[<i>Here</i> <span class="smcap">Isabel</span> <i>sinks down

minute.</p>
<p>[<i>Instead of</i> <span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>, <span

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas Jeremy I

<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s gone off
the place for a few minutes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Vexedly</i>.]&nbsp;
Ah, &rsquo;tis early for the Red Bull.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; Can I&mdash;can I do
anything for you, master?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Not unless you can
account for the sort of serving wench off the roadside what Jerry
has put upon us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; What is there to
account for in her, master?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Passionately</i>.]&nbsp; O I don&rsquo;t particular mind
about what&rsquo;s happened.&nbsp; Let her kiss with Robert if
she has the mind.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis always the man who
commences.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not.&nbsp;
There are some wenches who don&rsquo;t know how to leave anyone
alone.&nbsp; Worser than cattle flies, that sort.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Going across the
room to</i> <span class="smcap">Lubin&rsquo;s</span>

that sort of maid&mdash;you&rsquo;ll answer for
me&mdash;William?</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Lubin</span> <i>silently takes her
hand</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Her eyes fixed
on</i> <span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell
you what, John; I&rsquo;ll tell you, Kitty.&nbsp; I wish
I&rsquo;d held me to my first lover and I wish &rsquo;twas with
Lubin that I was a-going to the church to-day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Sullenly</i>.]&nbsp; Then I&rsquo;ll say sommat, Rose.&nbsp;
I wish &rsquo;twas with Isabel that I was getting wed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Now,
now&mdash;&rsquo;Tis like two children a quarrelling over their
playthings.&nbsp; Suppose you was to go and get yourself dressed,
Rose-Anna&mdash;And you too, Robert.&nbsp; Why, the traps will be
at the door afore you&rsquo;re ready if you don&rsquo;t quicken
yourselves up a bit.&nbsp; Kitty, you go and help your
sister.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>With a jealous
glance at Isabel</i>.]&nbsp; No, I&rsquo;ll have Lucy with
me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it, you
keep her out of mischief</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got my own
dress to put on.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; And Robert, you and me
will have a drink after all this caddle.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis dry
work getting ready for marriage so it appears.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis fiery dry
to my thinking.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Crossing the room
and going up to</i> <span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.]&nbsp; I
have no flowers to take to church with me, William; go you to the
waterside, I have a mind to carry some of the blue things what
grow there.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; Forget-me-nots, you
mean!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Forget-me-nots, I
mean.&nbsp; And none but you to gather them for me,
William.&nbsp; Because&mdash;because&mdash;well, you do put me in
thoughts of someone that I once held and now have lost.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s all.</p>

<p><i>The same room half an hour later</i>.&nbsp; <span

blossom which she ties together and lays on the window
sill</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Lubin</span> <i>comes in with
a large bunch of river forget-me-nots</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t think
to find you here, Isabel.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; O but that is a
beautiful blue flower.&nbsp; I will take the bunch
upstairs.&nbsp; She is all dressed and ready for it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Putting it on the
table</i>.]&nbsp; No&mdash;do you bide a moment here with me.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Isabel</span> <i>looks helplessly at</i>
<span class="smcap">Lubin</span> <i>who takes her hands slowly in
his</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; What are we going to
do?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; I wish as we had
never touched the seeds.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; O cursed seeds of
love&mdash;Far better to have left all as &rsquo;twas yesterday
in the morning.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; He has followed me
like my shadow, courting and courting me hard and all the time,
Lubin.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; She sought me out in
the yard at day-break, and what I&rsquo;d have given twenty years
of life for yester eve I could have thrown into the stream this
morning.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span> [<i>Sadly</i>.]&nbsp; So
&rsquo;tis with my feelings.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; She has altered
powerful, to my fancy, in these years.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; And Robert be
differenter too from what I do remember.&nbsp; [<i>A long
silence</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; Have you thought as it
might be in us two these changes have come about, Isabel?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; I was just the maid
as ever I was until&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; And so was I
unchanged, until I started travelling up on the same road as you,
Isabel.</p>
<p>[<i>For a few minutes they look gravely into one
another&rsquo;s eyes</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking</i> <span
class="smcap">Isabel&rsquo;s</span> <i>hands</i>.]&nbsp; So
that&rsquo;s how &rsquo;tis with you and me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; O Lubin&mdash;a poor
serving maid like I am.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have no one
else in the whole world.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; What could I have
seen in him, times gone by?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; And was it ever true
that I did sit through a long Sunday her hand in mine?&nbsp;
[<i>Another silence</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; But how&rsquo;s us
ever to get out of the caddle where we be?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Gaily</i>.]&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll just run away off to the Fair as t&rsquo;other
servants did.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; And leave them in
their hate for one another?&nbsp; No&mdash;&rsquo;twould be too
cruel.&nbsp; Us&rsquo;ll run to the young mistress what knows all
about them herbs.&nbsp; I count as there be seeds or sommat which
could set the hearts of them two back in the right places
again.&nbsp; Come&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; Have it your own way
then.&nbsp; But &rsquo;twill have to be done very quickly if
&rsquo;tis done at all.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; Us&rsquo;ll fly over
the ground like.</p>
<p>[<i>She puts her hand impetuously in</i> <span
class="smcap">Lubin&rsquo;s</span> <i>and they go out
together</i>.&nbsp; <i>As they do so</i>, <span

<p><i>A few minutes later</i>.&nbsp; <span

feathered bonnets</i>, <i>come to the room</i>.&nbsp; <i>They
carry fans and handkerchiefs in their hands</i>.&nbsp; <i>It is
seen that their gowns are not fastened at the back</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; Such a house I never
heard tell of.&nbsp; Ring, ring at the bell and no one to come
nigh.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Being unused to bells,
sister, maybe as us did pull them wrong or sommat.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; I wish we&rsquo;d had
the gowns made different.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; To do up in the
front&mdash;sensible like.</p>
<p>[<i>They twist and turn in front of the glass on the wall</i>,

<span class="smcap">Jeremy</span> <i>has come in and is watching
them sarcastically</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; Being as grey as
th&rsquo; old badger don&rsquo;t keep a female back from
vanity.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; O dear, Master Jeremy,
what a turn you did give me, to be sure.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t find no
one in this house to attend upon we.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; I count as you can
not.&nbsp; Bain&rsquo;t no one here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; We rang for the wench a
many time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; Ah, and you might
ring.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; We want someone
as&rsquo;ll fasten them niggly hooks to our gowns.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; Ah, and you may
want.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; Our sight bain&rsquo;t
clear enough to do one for t&rsquo;other, the eyelets be made so
small.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; Count as you&rsquo;ll
have to go unfastened then.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; O now you be a laughing
at us.&nbsp; Call the wench down, or we shall never be ready in
time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; Man and maid be both
gone off.&nbsp; Same as t&rsquo;others, us&rsquo;ll have to do
without service.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; Gone off!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Runned clean away?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s about
it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Well now, sister,
us&rsquo;ll have to ask the little Miss to help we.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve harnessed
the mare a many time.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t see why I shouldn&rsquo;t
get the both of you fixed into the shafts like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span> and <span
class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Fanning themselves
coyly</i>.]&nbsp; O Master Jeremy&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; Come now.&nbsp;
Let&rsquo;s have a try.&nbsp; I count as no one have a steadier
hand nor me this side of the river, nor a finer eye for seeing as
everything be in its place.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll settle the both of
you afore I gets out the horse and trap.&nbsp; Turn round.</p>
<p>[<i>The sisters turn awkwardly</i>, <i>and with very
self-conscious airs begin to flutter their fans</i>.&nbsp; <span

<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; O Mary&mdash;have you
come to help us in the fix where we are?&nbsp; [<i>He signs
to</i> <span class="smcap">Rose</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Robert</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; What has happened,
John?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you
in a couple of words, mistress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; No&mdash;do you fetch
the cider, dear Mister Jeremy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis more than I
can do with, Mary.&nbsp; Rose is set against Robert, and Robert
is set against Rose.&nbsp; Rose&mdash;well I&rsquo;m fairly
ashamed to mention it&mdash;Rose has lost her senses and would
wed the servant William&mdash;and Robert is a-courting of the
maid.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; Ah, let each fool
follow their own liking, says I.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; And sister and me all
dressed in our new gowns for the church.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; And Jerry had to do the
hooking for we, both of the servants having runned away.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Well, now I&rsquo;m
here I&rsquo;ll lend a hand.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll help with the
dinner time you&rsquo;re at church.&nbsp; You shall not need to
trouble about anything, Mr. John.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; O once I do get them to
the church and the ring fixed and all I shan&rsquo;t trouble
about nothing, Mary.&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis how to move them from
where they be!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the puzzle.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll never move
till the hand that gathered these flowers be here to raise
me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll sit here
to the end of the world sooner nor go along to be wed with Miss
over there.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis midsummer
heat have turned their brains.&nbsp; But I know a cooling draught
that will heal them of their sickness.&nbsp; Jeremy, do you step
into the garden and bring me a handful of fresh violet leaves,
one blossom from the heartsease and a sprig of rosemary.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Sighing</i>.]&nbsp; What next?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Get gone at once,
Jerry.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Jeremy</span> <i>goes to the
door</i>&mdash;<i>as he does so</i> <span
class="smcap">Liz</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Jane</span> <i>start up and follow him</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; Sister and me will come
along and help you, dear Mr. Jeremy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; And that us will, if
our new gowns bain&rsquo;t hooked too tight for we to bend.</p>
<p>[<i>They follow</i> <span class="smcap">Jeremy</span> <i>to
the garden</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Kitty</span>
<i>silently leaves the room also</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Rose</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Robert</span> <i>remain lost in their sorrowful
reflections</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">John</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>look at them for a moment and
then turn to one another</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Mary, I never thought
to see such a thing as this.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; You take my word for
it, John, the storm will soon be blown away.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how
I should stand up against the worry of it all, wasn&rsquo;t it
for you, Mary.</p>
<p>[<i>A short silence</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking</i> <span
class="smcap">Mary&rsquo;s</span> <i>hand</i>.]&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twill be a bit lonesome for me here, when they&rsquo;ve
gone off, Mary.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have Kitty
to do for you then.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Kitty be going to live
along of them at Bristol too, after a while.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking round the
room</i>.]&nbsp; Then I count as it might feel a bit desolate
like in this great house alone.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking</i> <span
class="smcap">Mary&rsquo;s</span> <i>hand</i>.]&nbsp; I cannot
face it, Mary.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve loved you many years, you
know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; I know you have, dear
John.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you forget
he what was false to you, days gone by, and take me as your
husband now?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Doubtfully</i>.]&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t hardly know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; You used to sing
sommat&mdash;the grass that was trampled under foot, give it
time, it will rise up again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Drying her
eyes</i>.]&nbsp; Ah, it has risen, dear John&mdash;and I count it
have covered the wound of those past days&mdash;my heart do tell
me so, this minute.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Holding both her
hands</i>.]&nbsp; Then &rsquo;tis one long midsummer afore you
and me, Mary.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how
&rsquo;twill be, dear John.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>, <i>followed by the
cousins</i>, <i>enters</i>.&nbsp; <i>He holds a bunch of leaves
towards</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; There you be,
mistress.&nbsp; Fools&rsquo; drink for fools.&nbsp; A mug of good
cider would have fetched them to their senses quicker.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>takes the bunch</i>,
<i>and still holding</i> <span class="smcap">John&rsquo;s</span>
<i>hand</i>, <i>leads him to the kitchen</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Jeremy</span> <i>watches the pair
sarcastically</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis all
finished with the master, then.</p>
<p>[<i>The sisters seat themselves on the couch and mop their
faces with handkerchiefs</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; Dear me, &rsquo;tis
warm.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; I hope my face
don&rsquo;t show mottled, sister?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; I was saying as how
&rsquo;twas all finished with the master.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Mary</span>, <i>followed by</i> <span
class="smcap">John</span>, <i>comes forward carrying two
glasses</i>.&nbsp; <i>She gives one to</i> <span
class="smcap">Rose</span> <i>and the other to</i> <span
class="smcap">Robert</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Now do you take a good
draught of this, the both of you.&nbsp; With violet leaves the
fever of the mind is calmed, and heartsease lightens every
trouble caused by love.&nbsp; Rosemary do put new life to anyone
with its sweetness, and cold spring water does the rest.</p>
<p>[<i>She leaves the table and stands far back in the room
by</i> <span class="smcap">John&rsquo;s</span> <i>side</i>.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Rose</span> <i>slowly lifts her glass and
begins to drink</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Robert</span>
<i>does the same</i>.&nbsp; <i>They are watched with anxiety by
all in the room</i>.&nbsp; <i>When they have emptied their
glasses</i> <span class="smcap">Rose</span> <i>dries her tears
and pushes the flowers a little way from her</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Robert</span> <i>shakes himself and moves the
cotton bonnet so that it falls unheeded to the floor</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Meanwhile</i> <span class="smcap">Kitty</span> <i>has come
quietly to the garden door and stands there watching the scene
intently</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; Bain&rsquo;t we going to
get a drink too?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Seems as though master
have been and forgot we.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Starting up and
going to the kitchen</i>.]&nbsp; If I&rsquo;ve been and forgot
you two old women, I&rsquo;ve remembered myself.&nbsp; Be blowed
if I can get through any more of this foolishness without a wet
of my mouth.</p>
<p>[<i>He goes out</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Speaking
faintly</i>.]&nbsp; Does it show upon my face, the crying,
Robert?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking at
her</i>.]&nbsp; No, no, Rose, your eyes be brighter nor ever they
were.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Pushing the
forget-me-nots yet further away</i>.]&nbsp; Those flowers are
dying.&nbsp; My fancy ones were best.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Coming forward
with the orange blossoms</i>.]&nbsp; Here they are, dear
Rose.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking
them</i>.]&nbsp; O how beautiful they do look.&nbsp; I declare I
can smell the sweetness coming out from them, Robert.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; All the orange
blossom in the world bain&rsquo;t so sweet as one kiss from your
lips, Rose.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Now is that truly
so?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; Ah, &rsquo;tis heavy
work a-waiting for the coach, Rose.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Coming forward and
taking</i> <span class="smcap">Mary&rsquo;s</span>
<i>hand</i>.]&nbsp; And yours won&rsquo;t be the only marriage
Rose-Anna.&nbsp; Did you never think that me and Mary
might&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Running
forward</i>.]&nbsp; But I did&mdash;O so many times, John.&nbsp;
[<span class="smcap">Jeremy</span> <i>enters with</i> <span
class="smcap">Lubin</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Isabel</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; Servants be comed
back.&nbsp; Man was to the Red Bull, I count.&nbsp; Female
a-washing and a-combing of herself in the barn.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Coldly</i>.]&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t care whether they be here or not.&nbsp; Set them to
work, Jerry, whilst we are to church.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it, Master
Jeremy.&nbsp; I was never so put out in my life, as when sister
did keep on ringing and the wench was not there to help us on
with our gowns.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Rose</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Robert</span> <i>get up and go towards the
door</i>.&nbsp; <i>They pause before</i> <span
class="smcap">Lubin</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Isabel</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; The man puts me in mind
of someone whom I knew before, called Lubin.&nbsp; I thought I
had a fancy for him once&mdash;but &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t really
so.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; And the girl do
favour a little servant wench from Framilode.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Jealously</i>.]&nbsp; You never went a-courting with a
servant wench, now did you, my heart&rsquo;s dearest?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; Never in all my days,
Rose.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas but the fanciful thoughts of a boy
towards she, that I had.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Putting her arm
in</i> <span class="smcap">Robert&rsquo;s</span>.]&nbsp; Well, we
have nothing to do with anything more of it now, dear Robert.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re about
right, my true love, we&rsquo;ll get us off to the church.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; Ah, coach have been
waiting a smartish while, I reckon.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis on master as
expense&rsquo;ll fall.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Rose</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Robert</span> <i>with cold glances at</i> <span
class="smcap">Lubin</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Isabel</span>, <i>pass out of the door</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Giving his arm
to</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>.]&nbsp; Now,
Mary&mdash;now, Kitty.&nbsp; [<i>They pass out</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liz</span>.&nbsp; Now, Jeremy, sister and
me bain&rsquo;t going off all alone.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Offering an arm
to each</i>.]&nbsp; No further than the church door, I say.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve better things to do nor a-giving of my arm to females
be they never so full of wiles.&nbsp; And you two do beat many
what bain&rsquo;t near so long in the tusk, ah, that you
does.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Jeremy</span> <i>goes out with the
sisters</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lubin</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Isabel</span>.]&nbsp; And shall we go off into the
meadows, Isabel, seeing that we are quite forgot?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isabel</span>.&nbsp; No&mdash;&rsquo;tis
through these faithless ones as us have learnt to understand the
hearts within of we.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s bide and get the marriage
dinner ready for them first.</p>

<h3>ACT I.&mdash;Scene 1.</h3>
<p><i>A country roadside</i>.&nbsp; <i>It is late afternoon and
already dusk</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">May Browning</span>
<i>with</i> <span class="smcap">Harry Moss</span> <i>come slowly
forward</i>.&nbsp; <i>Close to a stile which is a little off the
road</i>, <span class="smcap">May</span> <i>stops</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; There, you don&rsquo;t
need to come no further with I, Harry Moss.&nbsp; You get on
quick towards the town afore the night be upon you, and the snow,
too.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care
much about leaving you like this on the roadside, May.&nbsp; And
that&rsquo;s the truth, &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you take no
more thought for I, Harry.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a good boy as
you&rsquo;ve been to I since the day when we fell in
together.&nbsp; But now there bain&rsquo;t no more need for you
to hold back your steps, going slow and heavy when you might run
spry and light.&nbsp; For &rsquo;tis home as I be comed to now, I
be.&nbsp; You go your way.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; I see naught of any
house afore us or behind.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis very likely dusk as is
upon us, or may happen &rsquo;tis the fog getting up from the
river.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Coughing</i>.]&nbsp;
Look you across that stile, Harry.&nbsp; There be a field path,
bain&rsquo;t there?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking a few steps
to the right and peering through the gloom</i>.]&nbsp; Ah, and
that there be.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; And at t&rsquo;other end
of it a house what&rsquo;s got a garden fence all round.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; Ah&mdash;and
&rsquo;tis so.&nbsp; And now as I comes to look there be a light
shining from out the windows of it, too, though &rsquo;tis
shining dim-like in the mist.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis that
yonder&rsquo;s my home, Harry.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s the door where
I must stand and knock.</p>
<p>[<i>For a moment she draws the shawl over her face and is
shaken with weeping</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t take
on so, if &rsquo;twas me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; And did you say as how
there was a light in the window?&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill be but fire
light then, for th&rsquo; old woman she never would bring out the
lamp afore &rsquo;twas night, close-handed old she-cat as her
was, what&rsquo;d lick up a drop of oil on to the tongue of her
sooner nor it should go wasted.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; There, &rsquo;tis
shining better now&mdash;or maybe as the fog have shifted.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis nigh to home
as I be, Harry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; Then get and stand up
out of the wet grass there, and I&rsquo;ll go along of you a bit
further.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill not be much out of my way.&nbsp;
Nothing to take no count of.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; No, no, Harry.&nbsp; I
bain&rsquo;t going to cross that field, nor yet stand at the door
knocking till the dark has fallen on me.&nbsp; Why, is it like as
I&rsquo;d let them see me coming over the meadow and going
through the gate in this?&nbsp; [<i>Holding up a ragged
shawl</i>.]&nbsp; In these?&nbsp; [<i>Pointing to her broken
shoes</i>.]&nbsp; And&mdash;as I be to-day.</p>
<p>[<i>Spreading out her arms and then suddenly bending forward
in a fit of anguished coughing</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; There, there, you be
one as is too handy with the tongue, like.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
go for to waste the breath inside of you when you&rsquo;ll be
wanting all your words for they as bides up yonder and as
doesn&rsquo;t know that you be coming back.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Throwing apart her
shawl and struggling with her cough</i>.]&nbsp; Harry, you take
the tin and fill it at the ditch and give I to drink.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis all live coals within I here, so &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; You get along home,
and maybe as them&rsquo;ll find summat better nor water from the
ditch to give you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; No, no, what was I
a-saying to you?&nbsp; The dark must fall and cover me, or I
won&rsquo;t never go across the field nor a-nigh the house.&nbsp;
Give I to drink, give I to drink.&nbsp; And then let me bide in
quiet till all of the light be gone.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking out a tin
mug from the bundle beside her</i>.]&nbsp; Where be I to find
drink, and the frost lying stiff upon the ground?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Pointing</i>.]&nbsp;
Up yonder, where the ash tree do stand.&nbsp; Look you there,
&rsquo;tis a bit of spouting as do come through the hedge, and
water from it, flowing downwards away to the ditch.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Harry</span> <i>goes off with the
can</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">May</span> <i>watches him</i>,
<i>drawing her shawl again about her and striving to suppress a
fit of coughing</i>.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Harry</span> <i>returns and holds out the
can</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not very
quick as you&rsquo;ve been, Harry Moss.&nbsp; Here&mdash;give it
to I fast.&nbsp; Give!</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Harry</span> <i>puts the can towards her
and she takes it in her hands</i>, <i>which shake feverishly</i>,
<i>and she drinks with sharp avidity</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the taste as
I have thought on these many a year.&nbsp; Ah, and have gotten
into my mouth, too, when I did lay sleeping, that I have.&nbsp;
Water from yonder spout, with the taste of dead leaves sharp in
it.&nbsp; Drink of it, too, Harry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis no water as
I wants, May.&nbsp; Give I summat as&rsquo;ll lie more warm and
comfortable to th&rsquo; inside like.&nbsp; I bain&rsquo;t one
for much water, and that&rsquo;s the truth, &rsquo;tis.&nbsp;
[<i>He empties the water on the ground</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Then go you out upon
your way, Harry Moss, for the dark be gathering on us fast, and
there be many a mile afore you to the town, where the lamps do
shine and &rsquo;tis bright and warm in the places where they
sells the drink.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; Once I sets off
running by myself, I&rsquo;ll get there fast enough, May.&nbsp;
But I be going to stop along of you a bit more, for I don&rsquo;t
care much about letting you bide lonesome on the road, like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Then sit you down aside
of me, Harry, and the heat in my body, which is like flames,
shall maybe warm yourn, too.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Sitting down by
her side</i>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a fine thing to have a home what
you can get in and go to, May, with a bit of fire to heat the
limbs of you at, and plenty of victuals as you can put
inside.&nbsp; How was it as you ever came away from it, like?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Ah, and that&rsquo;s
what I be asking of myself most of the time, Harry!&nbsp; For,
&rsquo;tis summat like a twelve or eleven year since I shut the
door behind me and went out.</p>
<p>[<i>A slight pause</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Away from them all, upon
the road&mdash;so &rsquo;twas.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; And never see&rsquo;d
no more of them, nor sent to say how &rsquo;twas with you, nor
nothing?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Nor nothing,
Harry.&nbsp; Went out and shut the door behind me.&nbsp; And
&rsquo;twas finished.</p>
<p>[<i>A long pause</i>, <i>during which the darkness has
gathered</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; Whatever worked on you
for to do such a thing, May?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Bitterly</i>.]&nbsp;
Ah now, whatever did!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tweren&rsquo;t
as though you might have been a young wench, flighty like, all
for the town and for they as goes up and about the streets of
it.&nbsp; For, look you here, &rsquo;tis an old woman as you be
now, May, and has been a twenty year or more, I don&rsquo;t
doubt.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; An old woman be I,
Harry?&nbsp; Well, to the likes of you &rsquo;tis so, I
count.&nbsp; But a twelve year gone by, O, &rsquo;twas a fine
enough looking maid as I was then&mdash;Only a wild one, Harry, a
wild one, all for the free ways of the road and the lights of the
fair&mdash;And for the sun to rise in one place where I was, and
for I to be in t&rsquo;other when her should set.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d keep my
breath for when &rsquo;twas wanted, if &rsquo;twas me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Come, look I in the
face, Harry Moss, and tell I if so be as they&rsquo;ll be likely
to know I again up at home?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; How be I to tell you
such a thing, May, seeing that &rsquo;tis but a ten days or less
as I&rsquo;ve been along of you on the road?&nbsp; And seeing
that when you was a young wench I never knowed the looks of you
neither?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Say how the face of I do
seem to you now, Harry, and then I&rsquo;ll tell you how
&rsquo;twas in the days gone by?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis all too
dark like for to see clear, May.&nbsp; The night be coming upon
we wonderful fast.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; The hair, &rsquo;twas
bright upon my head eleven years gone by, Harry.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twas glancing, as might be the wing of a thrush, so
&rsquo;twas.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; Well, &rsquo;tis as
the frost might lie on a dead leaf now, May, that it be.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; And the colour on me was
as a rose, and my limbs was straight.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas fleet
like a rabbit as I could get about, the days that was then,
Harry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a poor old
bent woman as you be now, May.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Ah, Death have been
tapping on the door of my body this long while, but, please God,
I can hold me with the best of them yet, Harry, and that I
can.&nbsp; Victuals to th&rsquo; inside of I and a bit of
clothing to my bones, with summat to quiet this cough as doubles
of I up.&nbsp; Why, there, Harry, you won&rsquo;t know as
&rsquo;tis me when I&rsquo;ve been to home a day or two&mdash;or
may be as &rsquo;twill take a week.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; I count &rsquo;twill
take a rare lot of victuals afore you be set up as you once was,
May.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Look you in my eyes,
Harry.&nbsp; They may not know me up at home by the hair, which
is different to what &rsquo;twas, or by the form of me, which be
got poor and nesh like.&nbsp; But in the eye there don&rsquo;t
come never no change.&nbsp; So look you at they, Harry, and tell
I how it do appear to you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; There be darkness
lying atween you and me, May.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Then come you close to
I, Harry, and look well into they.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; Them be set open
wonderful wide and &rsquo;tis as though a heat comed out from
they.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not anyone as might care much for to look
into the eyes what you&rsquo;ve got.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; [<i>With
despondence</i>.]&nbsp; Maybe then, as them&rsquo;ll not know as
&rsquo;tis me, Harry Moss.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; I count as
they&rsquo;ll be hard put to, and that&rsquo;s the truth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; The note of me be
changed, too, with this cold what I have, and the breath of me so
short, but &rsquo;twon&rsquo;t be long, I count, afore they sees
who &rsquo;tis.&nbsp; Though all be changed to th&rsquo; eye
like, there&rsquo;ll be summat in me as&rsquo;ll tell they.&nbsp;
And &rsquo;tis not a thing of shape, nor of colour as&rsquo;ll
speak for I&mdash;But &rsquo;tis summat what do come straight out
of the hearts of we and do say better words for we nor what the
looks nor tongues of us might tell.&nbsp; You mind me, Harry,
there&rsquo;s that which will come out of me as&rsquo;ll bring
they to know who &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; Ah, I reckon as
you&rsquo;ll not let them bide till they does.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; And when they do know,
and when they sees who &rsquo;tis, I count as they&rsquo;ll be
good to me, I count they will.&nbsp; I did used to think as
Steve, he was a hard one, and th&rsquo; old woman what&rsquo;s
his mother, hard too&mdash;And that it did please him for to keep
a rein on me like, but I sees thing different now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; Ah, &rsquo;tis one
thing to see by candle and another by day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; For &rsquo;twas wild as
I was in the time gone by.&nbsp; Wild after pleasuring and the
noise in the town, and men a-looking at the countenance of I, and
a-turning back for to look again.&nbsp; But, hark you here,
&rsquo;tis powerful changed as I be now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; Ah, I count as you
be.&nbsp; Be changed from a young woman into an old one.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m finished with
the road journeying and standing about in the streets on market
days and the talk with men in the drinking places&mdash;Men what
don&rsquo;t want to look more nor once on I now, and what used to
follow if &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t only a bit of eyelid as I&rsquo;d
lift on them, times that is gone.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; Ah, &rsquo;twould take
a lot of looking to see you as you was.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Yes, I be finished with
all of it now, and willing for to bide quiet at the fireside and
to stay with the four walls round I and the door shut.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; I reckon as you
be.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m thinking
as they&rsquo;ll be rare pleased for to have I in the house
again.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill be another pair of hands to the work
like.&nbsp; And when I was young, &rsquo;twas not on work as I
was set much.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; Ah, I did guess as
much.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; But when I gets a bit
over this here nasty cough, &rsquo;tis a strong arm as
them&rsquo;ll have working for they; Steve, th&rsquo; old woman
what&rsquo;s his mother, and little Dorry, too.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; Dorry?&nbsp; I
han&rsquo;t heard tell of she.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my little
baby as was, Harry Moss.&nbsp; I left she crawling on the floor,
and now I count as she be growed into a rare big girl.&nbsp;
Bless the innocent heart of her!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; Whatever led you to do
such a thing, I can&rsquo;t think!&nbsp; You must have been drove
to it like, wasn&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas summat
inside of me as drove I, then.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas very likely the
blood of they gipsies which did leap in I, so that when I was
tied up to Steve, &rsquo;twas as if they had got I shut in a
box.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas the bridle on my head and the bit in the
mouth of I; and to be held in where once I had gone free.&nbsp;
[<i>A short pause</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; And I turned wild,
Harry, for the very birds seemed to be calling I from the hedges
to come out along of they, and the berries tossing in the wind,
and the leaves blowing away quick from where they&rsquo;d been
stuck all summer.&nbsp; All of it spoke to I, and stirred I
powerful, so that one morning when the sun was up and the breeze
running, I comed out into the air, Harry, and shut the door
behind I.&nbsp; And &rsquo;twas done&mdash;so &rsquo;twas.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; And didn&rsquo;t they
never try for to stop you, nor for to bring you back, May?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; No, Harry, they did
not.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; And where was it you
did go to, May, once you was out and the door shut ahind of
you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Ah&mdash;where!&nbsp; To
the east, to the south, every part.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas morning
with I in that time, and the heart of I was warm.&nbsp; And them
as went along of I on the road, did cast but one look into the
countenance of I.&nbsp; Then &rsquo;twas the best as they could
give as I might take; and &rsquo;twas for no lodging as I did
want when dark did come falling.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; And yet, look you
here, you be brought down terrible low, May.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; The fine looks of a
woman be as grass, Harry, and in the heat of the day they do
wither and die.&nbsp; And that what has once been a grand flower
in the hand of a man is dropped upon the ground and spat upon,
maybe.&nbsp; So &rsquo;twas with I.</p>
<p>[<i>She bows her head on her knees</i>, <i>and for a moment is
shaken with sudden grief</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you take
on so, May.&nbsp; Look you here, you be comed to the end of your
journeying this day, and that you be.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Raising her
head</i>.]&nbsp; Ah, &rsquo;tis so, &rsquo;tis so.&nbsp; And
&rsquo;tis rare glad as them&rsquo;ll be to see I once
again.&nbsp; Steve, he&rsquo;s a hard man, but a good
one&mdash;And I&rsquo;ll tell you this, Harry Moss, he&rsquo;ll
never take up with no woman what&rsquo;s not me&mdash;and that he
won&rsquo;t&mdash;I never knowed him much as look on one, times
past; and &rsquo;twill be the same as ever now, I reckon.&nbsp;
And little Dorry, &rsquo;twill be fine for her to get her mammy
back, I warrant&mdash;so &rsquo;twill.</p>
<p>[<i>A slight pause</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Th&rsquo; old
woman&mdash;well&mdash;I shan&rsquo;t take it amiss if her should
be dead, like.&nbsp; Her was always a smartish old vixen to I,
that her was, and her did rub it in powerful hard as Steve was
above I in his station and that.&nbsp; God rest the bones of she,
for I count her&rsquo;ll have been lying in the churchyard a good
few years by now.&nbsp; But I bain&rsquo;t one to bear malice,
and if so be as her&rsquo;s above ground, &rsquo;tis a rare poor
old wretch with no poison to the tongue of she, as her&rsquo;ll
be this day&mdash;so &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; Look you
here&mdash;the snow&rsquo;s begun to fall and &rsquo;tis
night.&nbsp; Get up and go in to them all yonder.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis thick dark now and there be no one on the road to see
you as you do go.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Help I to get off the
ground then, Harry, for the limbs of me be powerful weak.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Lifting her
up</i>.]&nbsp; The feel of your body be as burning wood, May.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Standing
up</i>.]&nbsp; Put me against the stile, Harry, and then let I
bide alone.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; Do you let me go over
the field along of you, May, just to the door.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; No, no, Harry, get you
off to the town and leave me to bide here a while in the quiet of
my thoughts.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis of little Dorry, and of how pleased
her&rsquo;ll be to see her mammy once again, as I be
thinking.&nbsp; But you, Harry Moss, as han&rsquo;t got no home
to go to, nor fireside, nor victuals, you set off towards the
town.&nbsp; And go you quick.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s summat
in me what doesn&rsquo;t care about leaving you so, May.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; And if ever you should
pass this way come spring-time, Harry, when the bloom is white on
the trees, and the lambs in the meadows, come you up to the house
yonder, and may be as I&rsquo;ll be able to give you summat to
keep in remembrance of me.&nbsp; For to-day, &rsquo;tis
empty-handed as I be.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want
nothing from you, May, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Fumbling in her
shawl</i>.]&nbsp; There, Harry&mdash;&rsquo;tis comed back to my
mind now.&nbsp; [<i>She takes out part of a loaf of
bread</i>.]&nbsp; Take you this bread.&nbsp; And to-night, when
you eats of it, think on me, and as how I be to home with Steve
a-holding of my hand and little Dorry close against me; and
plenty of good victuals, with a bed to lie upon warm.&nbsp;
There, Harry, take and eat.</p>
<p>[<i>She holds the bread to him.</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking the
bread</i>.]&nbsp; I count &rsquo;twill all be well with you now,
May?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; I warrant as
&rsquo;twill, for I be right to home.&nbsp; But go you towards
the town, Harry, for &rsquo;tis late.&nbsp; And God go with you,
my dear, now and all time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll set off
running then.&nbsp; For the night, &rsquo;tis upon us, May, and
the snow, &rsquo;tis thick in the air.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">May</span> <i>turns to the stile and
leans on it heavily</i>, <i>gazing across the field</i>.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Harry</span> <i>sets off quickly down the
road</i>.</p>
<h3>ACT II.&mdash;Scene 1.</h3>
<p><i>The living room in the Brownings&rsquo; cottage</i>.&nbsp;
<i>The room is divided by a curtain which screens the fireside
end from the draught of the principal door</i>.</p>
<p><i>To the right of the fireplace is a door leading
upstairs</i>.&nbsp; <i>Chairs are grouped round the hearth</i>,
<i>and there is a table at which</i> <span class="smcap">Jane
Browning</span> <i>is ironing a dress by the light of one
candle</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Dorry</span> <i>leans
against the table</i>, <i>watching her</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Putting aside the
iron</i>.]&nbsp; There, you take and lay it on the bed upstairs,
and mind you does it careful, for I&rsquo;m not a-going to iron
it twice.</p>
<p>[<i>She lays the dress carefully across</i> <span
class="smcap">Dorry&rsquo;s</span> <i>arms</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t the lace
look nice, Gran&rsquo;ma?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; You get along upstairs
and do as I says, and then come straight down again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t I put
it on once, Gran&rsquo;ma, just to see how it do look on me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; And get it all creased
up afore to-morrow!&nbsp; Whatever next!&nbsp; You go and lay it
on the bed this minute, do you hear?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Leaving the room
by the door to the right</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to put it on
just once, I would.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Jane Browning</span> <i>blows out the
candle and puts away the iron and ironing cloth</i>.&nbsp; <i>She
stirs up the fire and then sits down by it as</i> <span
class="smcap">Dorry</span> <i>comes back</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Dad&rsquo;s cleaning
of himself ever so&mdash;I heard the water splashing something
dreadful as I went by his door.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a-smartening
of hisself up for this here dancing as he be about, I reckon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Sitting down on a
stool</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to go along, too, and see the
dancing up at the schools to-night, I would.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; And what next, I should
like to know!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; And wear my new frock
what&rsquo;s ironed, and the beads what Miss Sims gived me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking out at the
window</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;m thinking as we shall get some snow
by and bye.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis come over so dark all of a
sudden.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t I go
along of they, Gran&rsquo;ma, and wear my new frock, and the
beads, too?&nbsp; I never see&rsquo;d them dance th&rsquo; old
year out yet, I haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Get along with you,
Dorry.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis many a year afore you&rsquo;ll be of an
age for such foolishness.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s what I calls it,
this messing about with dancing and music and I don&rsquo;t know
what.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Katie Sims be younger
nor me and she&rsquo;s let to go, she is.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; You bain&rsquo;t Katie
Sims, nor she you.&nbsp; And if the wedding what&rsquo;s
to-morrow isn&rsquo;t enough to stuff you up with nonsense, I
don&rsquo;t know what is.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; I wish it was
to-morrow now, Gran&rsquo;ma, I do.&nbsp; Shall you put on your
Sunday gown first thing, or wait till just afore we goes to
church?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; How your tongue do
go!&nbsp; Take and bide quiet a bit, if you knows how.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; I shall ask Dad if I
may go along of him and Miss Sims to the dance, I shall.&nbsp;
Dad&rsquo;s got that kind to me since last night&mdash;he gived
me a sixpence to buy sweets this morning when I hadn&rsquo;t
asked.&nbsp; And won&rsquo;t it be nice when Miss Sims comes here
to live, and when you has someone to help you in the work,
Gran&rsquo;ma?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Well&mdash;&rsquo;tis
to be hoped as &rsquo;twill be all right this time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; This time,
Gran&rsquo;ma!&nbsp; Why, wasn&rsquo;t it all right when Dad was
married afore, then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Getting the lamp
from a shelf</i>.]&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t light up as a rule till
&rsquo;tis six o&rsquo;clock, but I count it&rsquo;s a bit of
snow coming as have darkened the air like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Gran&rsquo;ma,
isn&rsquo;t Miss Sims nice-looking, don&rsquo;t you think?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d like to wear my hair like hers and have earrings
a-hanging from me and a-shaking when I moves my head, I
would.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Setting the lamp on
the table</i>.]&nbsp; Here, fetch me the matches, do.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Bringing the
matches</i>.]&nbsp; Was my mammy nice-looking, like Miss Sims,
Gran&rsquo;ma?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m one as goes
by other things nor looks&mdash;For like as not &rsquo;tis fine
looks as is the undoing of most girls as has them&mdash;give me a
plain face and a heart what&rsquo;s pure, I says, and &rsquo;tis
not far out as you&rsquo;ll be.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Was my mammy&rsquo;s
heart pure, Gran&rsquo;ma?&nbsp; [<i>A moment&rsquo;s
silence</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Jane</span> <i>lights the
lamp</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Dorry</span> <i>leans at the
table</i>, <i>watching her</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Was my
mammy&rsquo;s&mdash;[<i>A loud knock on the outside door</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s that come
bothering round!&nbsp; Run and see, Dorry, there&rsquo;s a good
child.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll be
Gran&rsquo;ma Vashti, I daresay.&nbsp; She do mostly knock at the
door loud with her stick.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Dorry</span> <i>runs to the window and
looks out</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis her, and
the snow white all upon her.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Dorry</span> <i>goes to the door to open
it</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To
herself</i>.]&nbsp; Of all the meddlesome old women&mdash;why
can&rsquo;t her bide till her&rsquo;s wanted.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Dorry</span> <i>opens the door wide</i>,
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Vashti</span> <i>Comes slowly in
to the room</i>, <i>leaning on a big staff</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Well, Vashti Reed, and
what brings you down from the hill to-day?&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould
have been better had you bid at home, with the dark coming on and
the snow.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Who has closed the
door</i>.]&nbsp; Sit down, Granny&mdash;there, close against the
fire, do.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Vashti</span> <i>stands in the middle of
the room</i>, <i>looking from one to another</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Sit down, Granny, by
the fire, do.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis in the
house and out of it as I have went.&nbsp; And down to the pool
where the ice do lie, and up on the fields where &rsquo;tis fog,
And there be summat in I what drives I onward, as might the
wind.&nbsp; And no where may the bones of me rest this day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; If &rsquo;tis to talk
your foolishness as you be come, you&rsquo;d best have stopped
away.&nbsp; Here, sit you down, Vashti Reed, and behave sensible,
and maybe as I&rsquo;ll get you summat warm to drink
presently.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Yes, Grannie, sit you
down along of we.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Vashti</span> <i>sits stiffly down by the
hearth</i>, <i>leaning on her stick</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Jane</span> <i>resumes her place</i>, <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Dorry</span> <i>puts her little stool between
them</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; And in the night when
I was laid down, against the windowpane it fled a three
times.&nbsp; A three time it fled and did beat the pane as though
&rsquo;twould get in.&nbsp; And I up and did open the
window.&nbsp; And the air it ran past I, and &rsquo;twas black,
with naught upon it but the smell of a shroud.&nbsp; So I
knowed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; What did you know,
Granny?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Leaning forward
and warming her hands at the fire</i>, <i>speaking as though to
herself</i>.]&nbsp; Summat lost&mdash;summat lost, and what was
trying to get safe away.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Safe away?&nbsp; From
what, Granny?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; And there be one what
walks abroad in the night time, what holds in the hand of him a
stick, greater nor this staff what I holds here, and the knife to
it be as long again by twice.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; O, Granny, I&rsquo;ll
be a-feared to go across the garden after dark, I shall.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; What do you want to go
and put that there into the child&rsquo;s head for?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d like for Steve to hear you talking of such stuff.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; I sat me down at the
table, but the victuals was as sand in the mouth, and the drink
did put but coldness within I.&nbsp; And when the door was
closed, &rsquo;twas as if one did come running round the house
and did beat upon it for to be let in.&nbsp; Then I did go for to
open it, but the place outside was full of emptiness, and
&rsquo;twas they old carrion crows what did talk to I out of the
storm.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; How you do go on, to be
sure!&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you speak of summat what&rsquo;s got
some sense to it?&nbsp; Come, don&rsquo;t you know as Steve, his
wedding day, &rsquo;tis to-morrow as ever is.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the New
Year, too, Granny, as well as Dad&rsquo;s marriage.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Suddenly</i>.]&nbsp; Be this house made ready for a-marrying,
then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Why, of course it be,
Granny.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see how &rsquo;tis cleaned and the
new net curtains in the windows, and the bit of drugget
&rsquo;gainst the door where the old one always tripped me
up?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; I see naught but what
&rsquo;tis more like a burial here.&nbsp; So &rsquo;tis.&nbsp;
And &rsquo;tis a burial as I&rsquo;ve carried in my heart as I
comed down from the hills.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking out of the
window</i>.]&nbsp; Granny, you&rsquo;ll be forced to bide the
night along of we, &rsquo;cause the snow be falling thick, and
&rsquo;twill be likely as not as you&rsquo;ll lose your way if
you start for to go home again when &rsquo;tis snowing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Th&rsquo; old thing may
as well bide the night now she be come.&nbsp; Hark you, Vashti,
&rsquo;twill save you the journey down to-morrow like, if you
bides the night, and the chimney corner is all as you ever
wants.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; And what should I be
journeying down to-morrow for, Jane Browning?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Why, Granny,
&rsquo;tis Dad&rsquo;s wedding day to-morrow, and &rsquo;tis a
white frock with lace to it as I&rsquo;m going to wear, and beads
what Miss Sims gived me, and the shoes what was new except for
being worn to church three times.&nbsp; Shall I fetch them all
and show to you, Granny?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Yes, run along and get
them, Dorry; very likely &rsquo;twill give her thoughts a turn,
looking at the things, seeing as she be in one of her nasty moods
to-day when you can&rsquo;t get a word what isn&rsquo;t
foolishness out of her.&nbsp; [<span class="smcap">Dorry</span>
<i>runs upstairs</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Leaning
forward</i>.]&nbsp; Was her telling of a marriage?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Why, yes, Vashti
Reed.&nbsp; And you know all about it, only you don&rsquo;t
trouble for to recollect nothing but what you dreams of yourself
in the night.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis our Steve what&rsquo;s going to
marry Annie Sims to-morrow.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; Steve Browning?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t
patience with th&rsquo; old gipsy!&nbsp; Yes&mdash;Steve.&nbsp;
And &rsquo;tis a twelvemonth or more as you&rsquo;d knowed of
it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; Our Steve,
what&rsquo;s husband to my May?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a fine thing
to fetch up May this evening, that &rsquo;tis.&nbsp; May, what
went out trolloping along the roads &rsquo;stead of she biding at
home to mind the house and child!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis how you did
breed she up, Vashti Reed, what led her to act as her did.&nbsp;
And if you&rsquo;d have bred her different, &rsquo;twould have
been all the same; for what&rsquo;s in the blood is bound to out
and show; and when you picks a weed and sets it in the room,
&rsquo;tain&rsquo;t no flower as you must look for.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis summat
like a twelve year since her went.&nbsp; But in the blinking of
an eye the latch might be raised, and she come through the door
again.&nbsp; God bless the head an feet of she!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; There you are, Vashti,
talking so foolish.&nbsp; A bad herb like she, was bound for to
meet her doom.&nbsp; And &rsquo;twas in the river up London way
where the body of her was catched, floating, and the same
petticoat to it as I&rsquo;ve seed on May a score of times.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you recollect how &rsquo;twas parson as brought the
news to we?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Taint with no
parsons as I do hold, nor with what may come from the mouths of
they, neither.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; And Steve, I knowed
what was in his mind when parson was gone out.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas
not much as he did say, being a man what hasn&rsquo;t many words
to his tongue.&nbsp; But he took and fetched down his big coat
what do hang up yonder, and told I to put a bit of black to the
sleeve of it.&nbsp; Leastways, he didn&rsquo;t speak the words,
but I seed what he was after, and I took and sewed a bit on, and
he&rsquo;s wore it ever since till yesterday&mdash;And
that&rsquo;s eleven year ago it be&mdash;so there.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; Her be moving about
upon the earth, her be.&nbsp; And I seems to feel the tread of
she at night time, and by day as well.&nbsp; Her bain&rsquo;t
shrouded, nor boxed, nor no churchyard sod above the limbs of
she&mdash;you take my words&mdash;and there shall come a day when
the latch shall rise and her be standing among us and a-calling
on her child and husband what&rsquo;s forgotten she.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; For goodness sake,
Vashti, have done speaking about such things to-night.&nbsp; If
Steve was to hear you, why I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if he was to
put you out of the door and into the snow&mdash;and &rsquo;tis
most unfitting for to talk so afore the child.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Calling out
loudly</i>.]&nbsp; Come back to I, May&mdash;you come back to
I&mdash;there bain&rsquo;t no one what thinks on the name of you,
or what wants you but your old mother.&nbsp; You come back to
I!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll thank you
for to shut your mouth, old Vashti!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t
nothing to be proud on as you&rsquo;ve got, and &rsquo;twould be
better if you was to be less free in your hollering.&nbsp; Look,
here&rsquo;s Dorry coming.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Dorry</span> <i>comes into the
kitchen</i>; <i>she is wearing her new white frock</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; See, Granny,
I&rsquo;ve been and put it on for to show you better.&nbsp; See
the lace?&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it nice?&nbsp; And the beads,
too.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t stop for to put on my shoes, nor my new
stockings.&nbsp; Nor my hat, what&rsquo;s got a great long
feather all round of it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; You bad, naughty girl,
Dorry, you&rsquo;ll crease and tumble that frock so as it&rsquo;s
not fit to be seen to-morrow!&nbsp; Whatever did you go to put it
on for?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; So as that Gran should
see something pretty, and so as she should come out of her
trouble.&nbsp; Gran&rsquo;s always got some trouble in her mind,
han&rsquo;t you, Granny?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; A twelve year gone
by, my child.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give it you
if you starts off again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; A twelve year gone
by&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; A twelve year gone by,
what then, Granny?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
more&rsquo;n eleven years since her wented out of the door, my
child&mdash;your poor mammy.&nbsp; Out of the door, out of the
door!&nbsp; And likely as not &rsquo;twill be feet first as her
shall be brought in again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Granny, was my poor
mammy, what&rsquo;s dead, nice looking like Miss Sims as is going
for to marry Dad, to-morrow?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas grand as
a tree in full leaf and the wind a-moving all the green of it as
was your mammy, my dear.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; And did she have fine
things to her, nice gowns and things, like Miss Sims, Granny?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas the looks
of her and the love of finery and pleasuring what was her
undoing, as &rsquo;twill be the undoing of you, too, Dorry, if
you don&rsquo;t take care.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis she as you favours,
and none of your father&rsquo;s people, more&rsquo;s the pity,
and &rsquo;tis more thoughtful and serious as you&rsquo;ll have
to grow if you don&rsquo;t want to come to harm.&nbsp; You take
and go right up, and off with that frock, do you hear me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; O, I wanted to be let
to go to the dancing now I&rsquo;d got it on, I did.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Dancing, there you
are!&nbsp; Dancing and finery, &rsquo;tis all as you do think on,
and &rsquo;tis plain to see what&rsquo;s got working in the
inside of you, Dorry.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the drop of bad blood as
you has got from she what bore you.&nbsp; But I might as well
speak to that door for all you cares.&nbsp; Only, hark you here,
you&rsquo;ll be sorry one of these days as you han&rsquo;t minded
me better.&nbsp; And then &rsquo;twill be too late.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Steve</span> <i>comes down the
stairs</i>, <i>pushes open the door and enters</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Well, Mother,
what&rsquo;s up now?&nbsp; Gran, you here?&nbsp; Why, Dorry, what
be you a-crying for?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; I wants to be let to
go to the dancing, Dad&mdash;now that I&rsquo;ve got my frock on
and all.&mdash;O, I wants to be let to go.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Well,
Mother&mdash;what do you say?&nbsp; &rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t hurt
for she to look in about half an hour, and Annie and me we could
bring her back betimes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; O, Dad, I wants to go
if &rsquo;twas only for a minute.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; There, there&mdash;you
shall go and we&rsquo;ll say no more about it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; I never knowed you give
in to her so foolish like this afore, Steve.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Well, Mother,
&rsquo;tain&rsquo;t every day as a man&rsquo;s married, that
&rsquo;tain&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; And so you&rsquo;re
to be wed come to-morrow, Steve?&nbsp; They tells me as
you&rsquo;re to be wed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right
enough, Gran.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Rising</i>.]&nbsp; And there be no resting in me to-day,
Steve.&nbsp; There be summat as burns quick in the bones of my
body and that will not let me bide.&mdash;And &rsquo;tis steps as
I hears on the roadside and in the fields&mdash;and &rsquo;tis a
bad taste as is in my victuals, and I must be moving, and peering
about, and a-taking cold water into my mouth for to do away with
the thing on my tongue, which is as the smell of death&mdash;So
&rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Now she&rsquo;s off
again!&nbsp; Come, sit you down, Vashti Reed, and I&rsquo;ll give
you summat as&rsquo;ll very likely warm you and keep you quiet in
your chair a while.&nbsp; Just you wait till I gets the water
boiling.</p>
<p>[<i>She begins to stir up the fire and sets a kettle on
it</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; [<i>From the
window</i>.]&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s Miss Sims coming up the path, and
Rosie too.&nbsp; O, they&rsquo;re wrapped up all over
&rsquo;cause &rsquo;tis snowing.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll open,
I&rsquo;ll open.</p>
<p>[<i>She runs to the door and unlatches it</i>.&nbsp; <span

<h3>ACT II.&mdash;Scene 2.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>As</i> <span
class="smcap">Steve</span> <i>takes off her cloak</i>.]&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis going to be a dreadful night.&nbsp; The snow&rsquo;s
coming down something cruel.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; There won&rsquo;t be
many to the dance if it keeps on like this, will there?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Get you to the fire,
both of you, and warm yourselves before we sets out again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Miss Sims, Miss
Sims&mdash;Miss Rosie&mdash;I&rsquo;m going along with you to the
dance, Dad says as I may.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Bless the child!&nbsp;
However her has worked upon her father, and he so strict, I
don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; Well, you be got up
fine and grand, Dorry&mdash;I shouldn&rsquo;t hardly know
&rsquo;twas you.&nbsp; [<i>Turning to</i> <span
class="smcap">Vashti Reed</span>.]&nbsp; Good evening, Mrs. Reed,
my eyes was very near blinded when I first got in out of the
dark, and I didn&rsquo;t see as you was there.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Good evening, Mrs.
Reed, and how be you keeping this cold weather?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Peering into
their faces as they stand near her</i>.]&nbsp; What be you
a-telling I of?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; We was saying, how be
you in this sharp weather, Mrs. Reed?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; How be I?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Yes, Mrs. Reed, how be
you a-keeping now &rsquo;tis come over such nasty weather?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; And how should an old
woman be, and her one child out in the rain and all the wind, and
driv&rsquo; there too by them as was laid like snakes in the
grass about the feet of she, ready for to overthrow she when her
should have gotten to a time of weakness.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Take no account of what
she do say, girls, but sit you down in the warm and bide till I
gets the time to take and look on the clothes which you have upon
you.&nbsp; [<i>Moving about and putting tea things on the
table</i>.]&nbsp; I be but just a-going to make a cup of tea for
th&rsquo; old woman, with a drop of summat strong to it as will
keep her from using of her tongue so free till morning time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Sitting
down</i>.]&nbsp; Poor old woman, &rsquo;tis a sad thing when
folks do come to such a pass as she.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; And han&rsquo;t got
their proper sense to them, nor nothing.&nbsp; But she&rsquo;s
better off nor a poor creature what we saw crouching below the
hedge as we was coming across the meadow.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; I says to Annie, &ldquo;it must be bad to have
no home to bide in such a night as this!&rdquo;&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t
that so, Mrs. Browning?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Ah, you&rsquo;re right
there, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t much
care to be upon the road to-night, would you, Steve?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; And at that hour when
th&rsquo; old year be passing out, and dark on all the land, the
graves shall open and give up the dead which be in they.&nbsp;
And, standing in the churchyard you may read the face to each, as
the corpses do go by.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s many a night as I have
stood and have looked into they when them did draw near to I, but
never the face I did seek.</p>
<p>[<i>Here</i> <span class="smcap">Jane</span>, <i>who has been
making a cup of tea</i>, <i>and who has poured something in it
from a bottle</i>, <i>advances to</i> <span
class="smcap">Vashti</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Here, Vashti Reed,
here&rsquo;s a nice cup of hot tea for you.&nbsp; Take and drink
it up and very likely &rsquo;twill warm th&rsquo; inside of you,
for I&rsquo;ll lay as you haven&rsquo;t seen a mouthful of naught
this day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Ah, that&rsquo;s it,
that&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; When folks do go leer &rsquo;tis a
powerful lot of fancies as do get from the stomach to the heads
of they.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Vashti</span> <i>takes the cup and slowly
drinks</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; O, Miss Sims, you do
look nice.&nbsp; Look, Gran&rsquo;ma, at what Miss Sims have got
on!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Putting down her
cup and leaning forward</i>.]&nbsp; Which of you be clothed for
marriage?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Get along of you, Gran,
&rsquo;tis for the dance up at the school as they be come.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; Come you
here&mdash;her what&rsquo;s to wed our Steve.&nbsp; Come you here
and let I look at you.&nbsp; My eyes bain&rsquo;t so quick as
they was once.&nbsp; Many tears have clouded they.&nbsp; But come
you here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Go along to her, Miss
Sims, Granny wants to look at your nice things.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Steps in front
of</i> <span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.]&nbsp; Here I be, Mrs.
Reed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; Be you the one
what&rsquo;s going to wed our Steve come New Year.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it, Mrs.
Reed, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; And be these garments
which you be clothed in for marriage or for burial?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Come, Granny, have
another cup of tea.&nbsp; Annie, don&rsquo;t you take no account
of she.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis worry and that as have caused the mind
of she to wander a bit, but she don&rsquo;t mean nothing by
it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; All right,
Steve.&nbsp; She don&rsquo;t trouble me at all.&nbsp; [<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis to be hoped
as I shall make a good wife to Steve, Mrs. Reed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; Steve!&nbsp; What do
Steve want with another wife?&nbsp; Han&rsquo;t he got one
already which is as a rose among the sow-thistles.&nbsp; What do
Steve want for with a new one then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Come on, girls.&nbsp;
I can&rsquo;t stand no more of this.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s off, and
call in to George&rsquo;s as we do go by.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; We did meet Mr. Davis
as we was coming along and he said as how &rsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t
be many minutes afore he joined us here, Steve.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right,
then we&rsquo;ll bide a bit longer till George do call for we,
only &rsquo;tis more nor I can stand when th&rsquo; old lady gets
her tongue moving.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Why, look,
Gran&rsquo;s fell asleep!&nbsp; O, Miss Sims, now that
Gran&rsquo;s dropped off and can&rsquo;t say none of her foolish
things any more, do stand so as Dad and Gran&rsquo;ma can see the
frock which you&rsquo;ve got for the dance.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; O, Dorry, you&rsquo;re
a little torment, that&rsquo;s the truth.</p>
<p>[<i>She gets up and turns slowly round so that all can see
what she has on</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Well, Steve?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Well, Rosie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t you got
nothing as you can say, Steve?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; What be I to say,
Rose?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Well, something of how
you thinks she looks, of course.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; O, &rsquo;tis all
right, I suppose.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; All right!&nbsp; And is
that about all as you&rsquo;ve seen?&nbsp; Why, bless you, Steve,
where have you gone and hid your tongue I should like to
know!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Well, there
bain&rsquo;t nothing wrong, be there?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Of course there
isn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But I never did see such a man as you,
Steve.&nbsp; Why, I don&rsquo;t believe as you&rsquo;d know
whether Annie haves a pair of eyes to her face or not, nor if
they be the same colour one to t&rsquo;other.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; I sees enough for
me.&nbsp; I sees as Annie is the girl as I&rsquo;ve picked out of
the whole world.&nbsp; And I know that to-morrow she and I is to
be made man and wife.&nbsp; And that be pretty nigh enough for me
this night, I reckon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; O, Miss Sims, do you
hear what Dad is saying?&nbsp; O, I wonder what I should feel if
&rsquo;twas me that was going to be married!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; You get and ask Annie
how &rsquo;tis with her, Dorry.&nbsp; I could tell a fine tale of
how as she do lie tossing half the nights, and of the candles
that&rsquo;s burned right down to the very end of them, I
could.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you go for
to listen to her, Dorry, nor Steve, neither.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
that flustered herself about the dance to-night that she scarce
do know what she&rsquo;s a-saying of.&nbsp; But suppose you was
just to ask her what she&rsquo;s got wrapped so careful in that
there paper in her hand.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; O, Rosie, whatever is
it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that
you&rsquo;ve got hold on now, Rosie?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; Come, show them all,
Rose.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Rose</span> <i>slowly unfolds the paper

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; No, Dorry,

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; No&mdash;I&rsquo;m not

Annie&mdash;that you shan&rsquo;t!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; That I shall,

was faint and weary of the sound and shape of he, and so on a day
when he was come&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Gran
gone off on her tales again.</p>

there aught a-going on with you and George, then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; No, Steve, there
isn&rsquo;t nothing in it much, except that George and me we
walked out last Sunday in the evening like&mdash;and a two or
three time before.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; And is it that you be
a-keeping of that flower for to give to George, then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Well&mdash;&rsquo;tis
for George as I&rsquo;ve saved it out of some what the gardener
up at Squire&rsquo;s gived me.</p>

sure there&rsquo;s no need for you to be upset over it.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis nothing to you who George walks out with, or who he
doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Who said as I was
upset, Rose?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Look at the long face
what you&rsquo;ve pulled.&nbsp; Annie, if &rsquo;twas me, I
shouldn&rsquo;t much care about marrying a man with such a look
to him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s up,
Steve?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s come over you like, all of a
minute?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis naught,
Annie, naught.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas summat of past times what comed
into the thoughts of me.&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis naught.&nbsp; And,
Rose, if so be as &rsquo;twas you as George is after, I&rsquo;d
wish him to have luck, with all my heart, I would, for George and
me&mdash;well, we too has always stuck close one to
t&rsquo;other, as you knows.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Ah&mdash;that you has,
George and you&mdash;you and George.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp;
Hark&mdash;there&rsquo;s someone coming up now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; O, let me open the
door&mdash;let me open it!</p>
<p>[<i>She runs across the room and lifts the latch</i>.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">George</span> <i>stands in the doorway
shaking the snow from him</i>.&nbsp; <i>Then he comes into the
room</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to the
dance, Mr. Davis.&nbsp; Look, haven&rsquo;t I got a nice frock
on?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Good evening, George,
and how be you to-night?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Nicely, Steve,
nicely.&nbsp; Good evening, Mrs. Browning.&nbsp; Miss Sims, good
evening&mdash;Yes, Steve, I&rsquo;ll off with my coat, for
&rsquo;tis pretty well sprinkled with snow, like.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Steve</span> <i>helps</i> <span
class="smcap">George</span> <i>to take off his overcoat</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; A happy New Year to
you, Mr. Davis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s a
thing which han&rsquo;t no luck to it, if &rsquo;tis said afore
the proper time, Rosie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Well, but &rsquo;tis
New Year&rsquo;s Eve, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Ah, so
&rsquo;tis&mdash;and a terrible nasty storm as ever I
knowed!&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas comed up very nigh to my knees, the
snow, as I was a-crossing of the meadow.&nbsp; And there lay some
poor thing sheltering below the hedge, with a bit of sacking
throwed over her.&nbsp; I count &rsquo;tis very near buried alive
as anyone would be as slept out in such a night.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; I reckon &rsquo;twould
be so&mdash;so &rsquo;twould.&nbsp; But come you in and give
yourself a warm; and Mother, what do you say to getting us a
glass of cider all round afore we sets out to the dancing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; What do you want to be
taking drinks here for, when &rsquo;tis free as you&rsquo;ll get
them up at the school?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Just a drop for to
warm we through.&nbsp; Here, I&rsquo;ll fetch it right away.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; No, you
don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have no one meddling in the pantry
save it&rsquo;s myself.&nbsp; Dorry, give me that there jug.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking a jug from
the dresser</i>.]&nbsp; Here &rsquo;tis, Gran&rsquo;ma, shall I
light the candle?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; So long as you&rsquo;ll
hold the matches careful.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; Well&mdash;&rsquo;tis
to be hoped as the weather&rsquo;ll change afore morning.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; We shall want a bit of
sunshine for the bride.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; That us shall, but it
don&rsquo;t look much as though we should get it.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Jane Browning</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Dorry</span> <i>go out of the room</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Sit you down, George,
along of we.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis right pleased as I be for to see
you here to-night.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Well, Steve, I
bain&rsquo;t one for a lot of words but I be powerful glad to see
you look as you does, and &rsquo;tis all joy as I wishes you and
her what&rsquo;s to be your wife, to-morrow.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; Thank you kindly, Mr.
Davis.&nbsp; I shall do my best for Steve, and a girl can&rsquo;t
do no more, can she?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; And so you&rsquo;re
going to church along of Steve, Mr. Davis?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis as Steve
do wish, but I be summat after a cow what has broke into the
flower gardens, places where there be many folk got together and
I among they.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; O, come, Mr. Davis!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis with me as
though t&rsquo;were all hoof and horn as I was made of.&nbsp; But
Steve, he be more used to mixing up with the quality folks and
such things, and he do know better nor I how to carry his self in
parts when the ground be thick on them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; Very likely &rsquo;tis
a-shewing of them into their places of a Sunday and a-ringing of
the bell and a-helping of the vicar along with the service, like,
as has made Steve so easy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rosie</span>.&nbsp; But, bless you, Mr.
Davis, you sees a good bit of the gentry, too, in your way, when
you goes in to houses, as it might be the Squire&rsquo;s for to
put up a shelf, or mend a window, and I don&rsquo;t know
what.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Ah, them caddling
sort of jobs don&rsquo;t much agree with I, Miss Rose.&nbsp; And
when I gets inside one of they great houses, where the maids do
pad about in boots what you can&rsquo;t hear, and do speak as
though &rsquo;twere church and parson at his sermon, I
can&rsquo;t think of naught but how &rsquo;twill feel for to be
out in the open again.&nbsp; Why, bless you, I do scarce fetch my
breath in one of they places from fear as there should be too
much sound to it, and the noise of my own hammer do very near
scare I into fits.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Well, Mr. Davis, who
would ever have thought it?</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Mrs. Browning</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Dorry</span> <i>come back and the cider is put upon
the table</i>, <span class="smcap">Dorry</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Annie</span> <i>getting glasses from the
dresser</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Drinking</i>.]&nbsp; Your health, Steve, and yours, too, Miss
Sims.&nbsp; And many years of happiness to you both.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Thank you kindly,
George.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; Thank you, Mr.
Davis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Hasn&rsquo;t Miss Sims
got a nice frock on her for the dance, Mr. Davis?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;m
blessed if I&rsquo;d taken no notice of it, Dorry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Why, you&rsquo;re
worse nor Dad, I do declare!&nbsp; But you just look at Rosie,
now, Mr. Davis, and ask her what she&rsquo;s got wrapped up in
that there paper in her hand.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; O, Dorry, you little
tease, you!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; You just ask her, Mr.
Davis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Undoing the
parcel</i>.]&nbsp; There, &rsquo;tis nothing to make such a
commotion of!&nbsp; Just a flower&mdash;see, Mr. Davis?&nbsp; I
knowed as it was one what you was partial to, and so I just
brought it along with me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; That there
bain&rsquo;t for I, be it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Indeed
&rsquo;tis&mdash;if so as you&rsquo;ll accept of it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; O, &rsquo;tis best
saved against to-morrow.&nbsp; The freshness will be most gone
from it, if I was to wear it now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; No, no, Mr. Davis,
&rsquo;tis for now!&nbsp; To wear at the dance.&nbsp; Put it on
him, Rosie, put it on him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Tossing the flower
across the table to</i> <span class="smcap">George</span>.]&nbsp;
He can put it on hisself well enough, Dorry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; [<i>After a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation</i>.]&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know so well
about that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; Go on, Rosie&mdash;pin
it into his coat.&nbsp; Come, &rsquo;tis getting late.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; O, pin it in quick,
Rosie&mdash;come along&mdash;and then we can start to the
dancing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Shall I, Mr. Davis?</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">George</span> <i>gets up and crosses the
room</i>; <span class="smcap">Rose</span> <i>takes the flower
and</i> <span class="smcap">Dorry</span> <i>hands her a
pin</i>.&nbsp; <i>She slowly pins the flower in his coat</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Stretching out his
hand to</i> <span class="smcap">Annie</span>.]&nbsp; You be so
quiet like to-night, Annie.&nbsp; There isn&rsquo;t nothing
wrong, is there, my dear?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis only
I&rsquo;m that full of gladness, Steve, as I don&rsquo;t seem to
find words to my tongue for the things what I can talk on most
days.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s how
&rsquo;tis with I, too, Annie.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis as though I was
out in the meadows, like&mdash;And as though &rsquo;twere Sunday,
and such a stillness all around that I might think &rsquo;twas
only me as was upon the earth.&nbsp; But then summat stirs in me
sudden and I knows that you be there, too, and &rsquo;tis my love
for you what has put me right away from the rest of them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; Steve, you&rsquo;ve
had a poor, rough time, I know, but I&rsquo;ll do my best for to
smooth it like for you, I will.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; See here,
Annie&mdash;I be comed out of the rain and into the sun once
more.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Leading</i> <span
class="smcap">George</span> <i>forward</i>.]&nbsp; See how fine
Mr. Davis do look&mdash;see, isn&rsquo;t he grand?&nbsp; O, Miss
Sims, see how nice the flower do look what Rosie has pinned in
his coat!&nbsp; See, Gran&rsquo;ma.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve enough to do
putting away all these glasses which have been messed up.&nbsp;
What I wants to know is when I shall get off to bed this night,
seeing as &rsquo;tis late already and you none of you gone off
yet.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; O, let us be off, let
us be off&mdash;and what am I to put over my dress,
Gran&rsquo;ma, so as the snow shan&rsquo;t get to it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; If you go careful and
don&rsquo;t drop it in the snow may be as I&rsquo;ll wrap my big
shawl around of you, Dorry, what&rsquo;s hanging behind the
door.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Give me my cloak,
Steve&mdash;O, how I do love a bit of dancing, don&rsquo;t you,
Mr. Davis?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; I be about as much
use in the ball room as one of they great drag horses, Miss
Rose.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; O, get on, Mr.
Davis!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe half what you do say, no more
does Annie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; If Mr. Davis
don&rsquo;t know how to dance right, you&rsquo;re the one to
learn him, Rose.&nbsp; Come, Dorry, you take hold of my hand, and
I&rsquo;ll look after you on the way.&nbsp; Good-night, Mrs.
Browning.&nbsp; Good-night, Mrs. Reed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Why, Granny&rsquo;s
sound asleep, Miss Sims, you know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; And about time,
too.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis to be hoped as we shan&rsquo;t have no more
trouble with her till morning.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Her eyes raised to
the door latch</i>.]&nbsp; Just look, why the latch is up.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; Whoever&rsquo;s that,
I wonder?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis very likely
someone with a horse what&rsquo;s lost a shoe, Steve.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; I guess as &rsquo;tis a
coffin wanted sudden, George Davis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; I bain&rsquo;t a-going
to shoe no horses this time of night, not if &rsquo;twas the King
hisself what stood at the door.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; If &rsquo;tis a
corpse, I guess her&rsquo;ll have to wait till the
dancing&rsquo;s finished, then.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Vashti</span> <i>groans in her sleep and

<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Us&rsquo;ll soon
see.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">George</span> <i>unbolts the door and

wide</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">May</span> <i>is seen

head and the lower part of her face</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s someone
what&rsquo;s missed their way, I count.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Why, &rsquo;tis like
the poor thing we seed beneath the hedge, I do believe.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span> Whatever can she want
a-coming-in here at this time of night!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Advancing
firmly</i>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis one of they dirty roadsters what
there&rsquo;s too many of all about the country.&nbsp; Here,
I&rsquo;ll learn you to come to folks&rsquo; houses this time of
night, disturbing of a wedding party.&nbsp; You take and get
gone.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t want such as you in here, we
don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">May</span> <i>looks fixedly into</i>
<span class="smcap">Jane&rsquo;s</span> <i>face</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; I count &rsquo;tis
very nigh starved by the cold as she be.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Looks like it, and
wetted through to the bone.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Put her out and shut
the door, George, and that&rsquo;ll learn the likes of she to
come round begging at folks&rsquo; houses what&rsquo;s
respectable.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis poor work
shutting the door on such as her this night.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; And that &rsquo;tis,
George, and what&rsquo;s more, I bain&rsquo;t a-going for to do
it.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis but a few hours to my wedding, and if a dog
was to come to me for shelter I&rsquo;d not be one to put him
from the door.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t to
be expected as I shall let a dirty tramp bide in my kitchen when
&rsquo;tis all cleaned up against to-morrow, Steve.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; To-morrow, &rsquo;tis
my day, Mother, and I&rsquo;ll have the choosing of my guests,
like.&nbsp; [<i>Turning to</i> <span
class="smcap">May</span>.]&nbsp; Come you in out of the
cold.&nbsp; This night you shall bide fed and warmed, so that,
may be, in years to come, &rsquo;twill please you to think back
upon the eve afore my wedding.</p>

<p><i>The same room</i>, <i>two hours later</i>.&nbsp; <span

before by the fireside</i>.&nbsp; <i>On the settle</i> <span

class="smcap">Steve</span>, <span class="smcap">Annie</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dorry</span> <i>enter</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Whatever kept you so
late, Steve, and me a-sitting up for to let you all in and not
able to get away to my bed?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; O, Gran&rsquo;ma, it
was beautiful, I could have stopped all night, I could.&nbsp; We
comed away early &rsquo;cause Miss Sims, she said as the dancing
gived her the headache, but the New Year han&rsquo;t been danced
in yet, it han&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; You get and dance off
to bed, Dorry, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve got to do&mdash;and
quickly.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; All right,
Gran&rsquo;ma.&nbsp; Good-night, Miss Sims; good-night,
Dad.&nbsp; O, why, there&rsquo;s Granny!&nbsp; But her&rsquo;s
tight asleep so I shan&rsquo;t say nothing to her.&nbsp; O, I do
wish as there was dancing, and lamps, and music playing every
night, I do!</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Dorry</span> <i>goes towards the
staircase door</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Calling after
her</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a-coming along directly.&nbsp; Be
careful with the candle, Dorry.</p>

<span class="smcap">Dorry</span> <i>goes upstairs</i>.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Steve</span> <i>and</i> <span

<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Was there aught as you
could do for yonder poor thing?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Poor thing,
indeed!&nbsp; A good-for-nothing roadster what&rsquo;s been and
got herself full of the drink, and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the
matter with she.&nbsp; See there, how she do lie, snoring asleep
under the shawl of her; and not a word nor sound have I got out
of she since giving her the drop of tea a while back.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Well, well&mdash;she
won&rsquo;t do us no harm where she do bide.&nbsp; Leave her in
the warm till &rsquo;tis daylight, then let her go her way.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; She and Gran&rsquo; be
about right company one for t&rsquo;other, I&rsquo;m
thinking.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Ah, that they
be.&nbsp; Let them sleep it off and you get up to bed,
Mother.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; That I will,
Steve.&nbsp; Be you a-going to see Annie safe to home?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; Do you bide here,
Steve, and let me run back&mdash;&rsquo;tis but a step&mdash;and
I don&rsquo;t like for you to come out into the snow again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m coming along
of you, Annie.&nbsp; Get off to bed, Mother.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be
back to lock up and all that in less nor ten minutes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; All right, Steve, and
do you cast an eye around to see as I han&rsquo;t left nothing
out as might get took away, for &rsquo;tis poor work leaving the
kitchen to roadsters and gipsies and the like.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Jane</span> <i>lights a candle and goes

<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; There&rsquo;ll be no

<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll bide
here, Annie, and &rsquo;tis more gladness than I can rightly
think on, that &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; Steve!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Well, Annie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s summat
what&rsquo;s been clouding you a bit this night.&nbsp; You
didn&rsquo;t know as how I&rsquo;d seen it, but &rsquo;twas
so.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Why, Annie, I
didn&rsquo;t think as how you&rsquo;d take notice as I was
different from ordinary.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; But I did,
Steve.&nbsp; And at the dancing there was summat in the looks of
you which put me in mind of a thing what&rsquo;s hurted.&nbsp;
Steve, I couldn&rsquo;t abide for to see you stand so sad with
the music going on and all.&nbsp; So I told you as I&rsquo;d the
headache.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; O Annie, &rsquo;twas
thoughts as was too heavy for me, and I couldn&rsquo;t seem to
get them pushed aside, like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; How&rsquo;d it be if
you was to tell me, Steve.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t much
care for to, Annie.&nbsp; But &rsquo;twas thoughts what comed out
of the time gone by, as may be I&rsquo;d been a bit too hard
with&mdash;with her as was Dorry&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; O, I&rsquo;m sure,
from all I hear, as she had nothing to grumble at, Steve.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; And there came a
fearsome thought, too, Annie, as you might go the same way
through not getting on comfortable with me, and me being so much
older nor you, and such-like.&nbsp; Annie, I couldn&rsquo;t bear
for it to happen so, I could not.&nbsp; For I holds to having you
aside of me always stronger nor I holds to anything else in the
world, and I could not stand it if &rsquo;twas as I should lose
you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing
in the world as could make you lose me, Steve.&nbsp; For, look
you here, I don&rsquo;t think as there&rsquo;s a woman on the
earth what&rsquo;s got such a feeling as is in my heart this
night, of quiet, Steve, and of gladness, because that you and me
is to be wed and to live aside of one another till death do part
us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Them be good words,
Annie, and no mistake.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; And what you feels
about the days gone by don&rsquo;t count, Steve, &rsquo;cause
they bain&rsquo;t true of you.&nbsp; You was always a kind
husband, and from what I&rsquo;ve hear-ed folks say, she was one
as wasn&rsquo;t never suited to neither you nor yours.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Poor soul, she be dead
and gone now, and what I thinks one way or t&rsquo;other
can&rsquo;t do she no good.&nbsp; Only &rsquo;tis upon me as I
could take you to-morrow more glad-like, Annie, if so be as I had
been kinder to she, the time her was here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; Do you go off to bed,
Steve, you&rsquo;re regular done up, and that&rsquo;s what
&rsquo;tis.&nbsp; I never hear-ed you take on like this
afore.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; All right, my dear,
don&rsquo;t you mind what I&rsquo;ve been saying.&nbsp; Very like
&rsquo;tis a bit unnerved as I be this night.&nbsp; But
&rsquo;tis a good thought, bain&rsquo;t it, Annie, that come
to-morrow at this time, there won&rsquo;t be no more need for us
to part?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; [<i>As he opens the

<h3>ACT II.&mdash;Scene 4.</h3>
<p><i>The fire is almost out</i>.&nbsp; <i>A square of moonlight
falls on the floor from the window</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Vashti</span> <i>still sleeps in the chimney
corner</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">May</span> <i>is rocking
herself to and fro on the settle</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Get off to your drunken
sleep and to your dreams!&nbsp; Your dreams&mdash;your
dreams&mdash;Ah, where is it as they have gone, I&rsquo;d like
for to know.&nbsp; The dreams as comed to I when I was laid
beneath the hedge.&nbsp; Dreams!</p>
<p>[<i>She gets up</i>, <i>feels down the wall in a familiar way
for the bellows&mdash;blows up the fire and puts some coal on it
gently</i>.&nbsp; <i>Then she draws forward a chair and sits down
before it</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Muttering to
herself</i>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis my own hearth when &rsquo;tis all
said and done.</p>
<p>[<i>She turns up the front of her skirt and warms herself</i>,
<i>looking sharply at</i> <span class="smcap">Vashti Reed</span>
<i>now and then</i>.</p>
<p>[<i>Presently</i> <span class="smcap">Vashti&rsquo;s</span>

<i>and then with recognition</i>, <i>on</i> <span
class="smcap">May&rsquo;s</span> <i>face</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; So you be comed back,
May.&nbsp; I always knowed as you would.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; How did you know
&rsquo;twas me, then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Cause I
knowed.&nbsp; There &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; I be that changed from
the times when I would sit a-warming of myself by this here
fire.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; Ah, and be you
changed, May?&nbsp; My eyes don&rsquo;t see nothing of it,
then.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Ah, I be got into an
ugly old woman now, mother, and Steve&mdash;Steve, he looked in
the face of I and didn&rsquo;t so much as think who
&rsquo;twas.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get off to the drunken sleep of you and
to your dreams.&rdquo;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas that what he did say to
I.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; Your old mother do
know better nor Steve.&nbsp; Ah, &rsquo;tweren&rsquo;t in no
shroud as I seed you, May, nor yet with the sod upon the face of
you, but stepping, stepping up and down on the earth, through the
water what layed on the roads, and on the dry where there be high
places, and in the grass of the meadows.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how
&rsquo;twas as I did see you, May.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; And I would like to know
how &rsquo;twas as Steve saw I.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; Ah, and there was
they as did buzz around as thick as waspes in summer time and as
said, &ldquo;She be under ground and rotting now&mdash;that her
be.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they seed in I but a poor old woman what was
sleeping in the chimney corner, with no hearing to I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Rotting yourself,&rdquo; I says, and I rears up sudden,
&ldquo;She be there as a great tree and all the leaves of it full
out&mdash;and you&mdash;snakes in the grass, snakes in the grass,
all of you!&rdquo;&nbsp; There &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Mockingly</i>.]&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thought,
bain&rsquo;t it, Annie, that to-morrow this time there
won&rsquo;t be no need for us to part?&rdquo;&nbsp; And in the
days when I was a young woman and all the bloom of I upon me,
&rsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t have been once as he&rsquo;d have looked
on such as her.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis full
of bloom and rare fine and handsome as you appear now, May,
leastways to my old eyes.&nbsp; And when you goes up to Steve and
shows yourself, I take it the door&rsquo;ll be shut in the face
of the mealy one what they&rsquo;ve all been so took up with this
long while.&nbsp; I count that &rsquo;twill and no mistake.&nbsp;
So &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Fiercely</i>.]&nbsp;
Hark you here, Mother, and &rsquo;tis to be wed to-morrow as they
be!&nbsp; Wed&mdash;the both of them, the both of them!&nbsp; And
me in my flesh, and wife to Steve!&nbsp; &ldquo;Can I cover you
up with a bit of old sack or summat?&rdquo;&nbsp; Old sack!&nbsp;
When there be a coverlet with feathers to it stretched over where
he do lie upstairs.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you out when
&rsquo;tis morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ah, you will, will you, Steve
Browning?&nbsp; Us&rsquo;ll see how &rsquo;twill be when
&rsquo;tis morning&mdash;Us&rsquo;ll see, just won&rsquo;t us
then!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; Ah, &rsquo;tis in her
place as th&rsquo; old woman will be set come morning&mdash;And
that her&rsquo;ll be&mdash;I count as &rsquo;tis long enough as
her have mistressed it over the house.&nbsp; [<i>Shaking her fist
towards the ceiling</i>.]&nbsp; You old she fox, you may gather
the pads of you in under of you now, and crouch you down
t&rsquo;other side of the fire like any other old woman of your
years&mdash;for my May&rsquo;s comed back, and her&rsquo;ll show
you your place what you&rsquo;ve not known where &rsquo;twas in
all the days of your old wicked life.&nbsp; So &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Her han&rsquo;t changed
a hair of her, th&rsquo; old stoat!&nbsp; Soon as I heard the
note of she, the heat bubbled up in I, though &rsquo;twas
chattering in the cold as I had been but a moment afore.&nbsp;
&ldquo;One of they dirty roadsters&mdash;I&rsquo;ll learn you to
come disturbing of a wedding party, I will.&rdquo;&nbsp;
[<i>Shaking her fist towards the ceiling</i>.]&nbsp; No, you
bain&rsquo;t changed, you hardened old sinner&mdash;but the words
out of the cruel old mouth of you don&rsquo;t hurt I any
more&mdash;not they.&nbsp; I be passed out of the power of such
as you.&nbsp; I knowed I&rsquo;d have to face you when I comed
back, but I knowed, too, as I should brush you out of the way of
me, like I would brush one of they old maid flies.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; Ah, and so I telled
she many a time.&nbsp; &ldquo;You bide till my May be comed
home,&rdquo; I says.&nbsp; &ldquo;She be already put safe to bed
and &rsquo;tis in the churchyard where her do take her
rest,&rdquo; says she.&nbsp; Ah, what a great liar that is,
th&rsquo; old woman what&rsquo;s Steve&rsquo;s mother!&nbsp; And
the lies they do grow right out of she tall as rushes, and the
wind do blow they to the left and to the right.&nbsp; So
&rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Ah, she han&rsquo;t any
more power for to hurt I in the ugly old body of her.&nbsp; I be
got beyond she.&nbsp; There be but one or two things as can touch
I now&mdash;But one or two.&nbsp; And I be struck to the heart, I
be, struck to the heart.</p>
<p>[<i>She bends forwards</i>, <i>rocking herself to and fro and
weeping</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; [<i>As though speaking
to herself</i>.]&nbsp; Back and fro, back and fro&mdash;On the
dark of the earth and where &rsquo;twas light.&nbsp; When
&rsquo;twas cold and no sound but the steps of I on the road, and
the fox&rsquo;s bark; when &rsquo;twas hot and the white dust
smouldered in the mouth of I, and things flying did plague I with
the wings of they&mdash;But &rsquo;twas always the same thought
as I had&mdash;&ldquo;Some day I shall come back to Steve,&rdquo;
I did tell me.&nbsp; And then again&mdash;&ldquo;Some day I shall
get and hold Dorry in my arms.&rdquo;&nbsp; And now I be
comed.&nbsp; And Steve&mdash;and Steve&mdash;Ah, I be struck deep
to the heart, &rsquo;tis so.&nbsp; Struck deep!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; You get upstairs to
Steve, May.&nbsp; Get you up there and take the place
what&rsquo;s yours.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; My place, my
place!&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s that I want to know!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
another what&rsquo;s got into the nest now, to lie snug and warm
within.&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis for I to spread the wings of me and
to go out into the storm again.&nbsp; So &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; Get you to Steve,
May, and let him but look on the form of you and on the bloom,
and us&rsquo;ll see what he will do with t&rsquo;other hussy
then.&nbsp; Ah, they sneaking, mealy wenches what have got
fattened up and licked over by th&rsquo; old woman till
&rsquo;tis queens as they fancies theirselves, you shall tell
they summat about what they be, come morning.&nbsp; And your poor
old mother, her&rsquo;ll speak, too, what hasn&rsquo;t been let
sound her tongue these years gone by.&nbsp; Ah, hern shall know
what us do think of they, hern shall squat upon the floor and
hear the truth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; He thought as I was
sleeping; but I looked out on her and seed the way his eyes was
cast upon the girl.&nbsp; Steve, if you had cast your eyes on me
like that but once, in days gone by&mdash;maybe, maybe I&rsquo;d
not have gone out and shut the door behind I.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; Get you to Steve and
let him see you with the candle lit.&nbsp; Her bain&rsquo;t no
match for he, the young weasel!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis you as has the
blood of me and my people what was grand folk in times gone by,
&rsquo;tis you, May, as is the mate for he, above all them
white-jowled things what has honey at the mouth of they, but the
heart running over with poison&mdash;Ah, and what throws you the
bone and keeps the meat for their own bellies.&nbsp; What sets
the skin afore you and laps the cream theirselves.&nbsp; Vipers,
all of them, and she-cats.&nbsp; There &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Sit you down, Mother,
and keep the tongue of you quiet.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t want for
to waken they.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Sitting down
heavily</i>.]&nbsp; But we&rsquo;ve got to waken Steve for he to
know as how you be comed home again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; And where&rsquo;s the
good of that, when there bain&rsquo;t so much as a board nor a
rag, but what&rsquo;s been stole from I?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; You go and say to him
as &rsquo;tis his wife what have come back to her place.&nbsp;
And put th&rsquo; old woman against the chimney there, and let
her see you a-cutting of the bread and of the meat, and a-setting
out of the food so as that they who be at the table can loose the
garments of them when the eating &rsquo;tis finished, if they has
a mind to, &rsquo;stead of drawing they together so not to feel
&rsquo;tis leer.&nbsp; Ah, &rsquo;tis time you be comed, May,
&rsquo;tis time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Bitterly</i>.]&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m thinking &rsquo;tis time!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the lies
of they be growed big as wheat stalks and the hardness of their
hearts be worse nor death.&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis to judgment as
they shall be led, now you be comed home, May, and the hand of
God shall catch they when they do crawl like adders upon the
earth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, and do you mind how &rsquo;twas you
served old Vashti, what never did harm to no one all the life of
her,&rdquo; I shall call out to th&rsquo; old woman in that hour
when her shall be burning in the lake.&nbsp; And her shall beg
for a drop of water to lay upon the withered tongue of she, and
it shall be denied, for other hands nor ours be at work, and
&rsquo;tis the wicked as shall perish&mdash;yes, so
&rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Who has been bending
forward</i>, <i>looking steadily into the fire</i>.]&nbsp; Stop
that, Mother, I wants to get at my thoughts.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; Be you a-going to set
on I, too, May, now that you be comed home.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis poor
work for an old woman like I.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; [<i>As though to
herself</i>.]&nbsp; And as I was laid beneath the
hedge&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis cold as my limbs is, now,&rdquo; I
says, &ldquo;but I shall be warm this night.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the
pangs what was in the body of me did fairly quail
I&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis my fill of victuals as I shall soon put
within,&rdquo; thinks I.&nbsp; And they was laid a bit.&nbsp; The
bleakness of the tempest fell on I, but &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t
feel lonesome no longer than this hour,&rdquo; I telled me.&nbsp;
For to my thinking, Steve, he was waiting all the time till I
should be comed back.&nbsp; And Dorry, too.&nbsp; There
&rsquo;tis.&nbsp; [<i>A long silence</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d have been
content to bide with the door shut&mdash;so long as it was shut
with they two and me inside the room&mdash;th&rsquo; old
woman&mdash;well, I count I shouldn&rsquo;t have took many
thought for she&mdash;she could have bided in her place if
she&rsquo;d had a mind&mdash;I&rsquo;d have set me down, when
once my clothes was decent and clean, and put my hands to the
work and made a tidy wife for Steve, as good nor better than that
there dressed-up thing out yonder&mdash;And bred Dorry up the
right way, too, I would.&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis done with now, so
&rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; [<i>As though to
herself</i>.]&nbsp; And when &rsquo;tis morning and she gets her
down&mdash;&ldquo;There, &rsquo;tis my girl as is mistress here,
I&rsquo;ll say to her&mdash;and &rsquo;tis my girl as shall sit
cup end of the table&mdash;and you get you to the fire corner and
bide there, like the poor old woman as you be, spite that you do
slip about so spry on the wicked old legs of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; And I could set she back
in her place, too, that tricked-up, flashy thing over the
way.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve but to climb the stairs and clap my hand on
Steve&mdash;&ldquo;Get you from your dreams,&rdquo; I have got
but to say, &ldquo;the woman what&rsquo;s yourn be comed
home.&nbsp; Her have tasted the cup of death, very near, and her
have been a-thirst and an hungered.&nbsp; But her has carried
summat for you in her heart all the way what you wouldn&rsquo;t
find in the heart of t&rsquo;other, no, not if you was to cut it
open and search it through.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the right belongs to
I to shut the door on t&rsquo;other hussey, holding Steve to I
till death divides we.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; Going on the road I
seed the eyes of they blinking as I did pass by.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
may the light from out the thunder cloud fall upon you,&rdquo; I
says to them, &ldquo;for &rsquo;tis a poor old woman as I be what
has lost her child; and what&rsquo;s that to you if so be as the
shoes on her feet be broken or no?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis naked as the
toes of you shall go, that hour when the days of this world shall
be rolled by.&nbsp; Ah, &rsquo;tis naked and set on the lake of
burning fire as the hoofs of you shall run!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; I could up and screech
so that the house should ring with the sound of me, &ldquo;I be
your wife, Steve, comed back after these many years.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s this that you&rsquo;ve got doing with
another?&rdquo;&nbsp; I could take hold on him and make him look
into the eyes of I, yes, and th&rsquo; old woman, too.&nbsp;
&ldquo;See here, your &lsquo;dirty roadster,&rsquo; look well on
to her.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, &rsquo;tis May.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
the eyes of him would then be cast so that I should see no more
than a house what has dead within, and the blind pulled
down.&nbsp; And I, what was thinking as there might be a light in
the window!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you may
holler,&rdquo; I says to them, &ldquo;you may holler till you be
heard over the face of all the earth, but no one won&rsquo;t take
no account of you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the lies of them which have
turned into ropes of hempen shall come up and strangle
they.&nbsp; But me and my child shall pass by all fatted up and
clothed, and with the last flick, afore the eyelids of they drop,
they shall behold we, and, a-clapping of the teeth of them shall
they repent them of their sins.&nbsp; Too late, too late!&nbsp;
There &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Too late!&nbsp; There
&rsquo;tis, I be comed home too late.</p>
<p>[<i>She rises and takes up her shawl</i>, <i>wrapping it about
her shoulders</i>, <i>and muttering</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; But I know a dark place
full of water&mdash;&rsquo;Tis Simon&rsquo;s pool they calls
it&mdash;And I warrant as any poor wretch might sleep yonder and
be in quiet.</p>

What&rsquo;s it to Steve whether the like of I do go or

Steve&rsquo;s got in him?&nbsp; Dead leaves for new.&nbsp; Ditch
water for the clear spring.</p>

with the honey.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t my way to snatch from
no one so that the emptiness which I has in me shall be
fed.&nbsp; There, &rsquo;tis finished now, very nigh, and the
sharpness done.&nbsp; And, don&rsquo;t you fear, Steve, as ever
I&rsquo;ll trouble you no more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Sitting down by</i>

this night, and &rsquo;tis out upon the roads as I be
going.&nbsp; Th&rsquo; old woman&mdash;there&rsquo;s naught much
changed in she&mdash;And Steve&mdash;well, Steve be wonderful
hard in the soul of him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can I get you an old

I&mdash;Ah&mdash;&rsquo;tis more than enough to turn the stomach
in anyone&mdash;that it is.&nbsp; [<i>A slight pause</i>.</p>

have.&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis the air blowing free upon the road as
I craves&mdash;Ah, and the wind which hollers, so that the cries
of we be less nor they of lambs new born.</p>

here&mdash;and here&mdash;See what&rsquo;s been done to I

<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Hark you here, Mother,
and keep your screeching till another time.&nbsp; I wants to slip
out quiet so as Steve and th&rsquo; old woman won&rsquo;t never
know as I&rsquo;ve been nigh.&nbsp; And if you keeps your mouth
shut, maybe I&rsquo;ll drop in at our own place on the hill one
of these days and bide comfortable along of you, only
now&mdash;I&rsquo;m off, do you hear?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t abide
for you to go.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis more nor I can stand.&nbsp; Why,
if you goes, May, &rsquo;tis t&rsquo;other wench and th&rsquo;
old woman what&rsquo;ll get mistressing it here again in your
place.&nbsp; [<i>Rising up</i>.]&nbsp; No&mdash;you shan&rsquo;t
go.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll holler till I&rsquo;ve waked them every
one&mdash;you shan&rsquo;t!&nbsp; My only child, my pretty
May!&nbsp; Ah, &rsquo;tis not likely as you shall slip off
again.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Look you here,
Mother&mdash;bide still, I say.&nbsp; [<i>Looking round the room
distractedly</i>.]&nbsp; See here&mdash;&rsquo;tis rare dry as I
be.&nbsp; You bide quiet and us&rsquo;ll have a drink together,
that us will.&nbsp; Look, th&rsquo; old woman&rsquo;s forgot to
put away the bottle, us&rsquo;ll wet our mouths nice and quiet,
mother&mdash;she won&rsquo;t hear I taking out the cork, nor
nothing.&nbsp; See!</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">May</span> <i>gets up and crosses the
room</i>; <i>she takes the bottle off the shelf where she has
just perceived it</i>, <i>and also two glasses</i>; <i>she fills
one and hands it to her mother</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Stretching out
her hand</i>.]&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis rare dry and parched as I be, now
I comes to think on it, May.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
right&mdash;drink your fill, Mother.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis pleasant
for I to see you mistressing it here again, May.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Ah, &rsquo;tis my own
drink and all, come to that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; So &rsquo;tis.&nbsp;
And the tea what she gived me was but ditch water.&nbsp; I seed
her spoon it in the pot, and &rsquo;twas not above a half spoon
as her did put in for I, th&rsquo; old badger.&nbsp; My eye was
on she, though, and her&rsquo;ll have it cast up at she when the
last day shall come and the trumpet sound and all flesh stand
quailing, and me and mine looking on at her as is brought to
judgment.&nbsp; How will it be then, you old sinner, says I.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Re-filling the
glass</i>.]&nbsp; Take and drink this little drop more,
mother.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Vashti</span> <i>drinks and then leans
back in her chair again with half closed eyes</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Putting away the
bottle and glasses</i>.]&nbsp; Her&rsquo;ll sleep very like,
now.&nbsp; And when her wakes, I take it &rsquo;twill appear as
though she&rsquo;d been and dreamt summat.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; Do you sit a-nigh me,
May.&nbsp; The night be a wild one.&nbsp; I would not have you be
on the roads.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Sitting down beside
her</i>.]&nbsp; O, the roads be fine on nights when the tempest
moves in the trees above and the rain falls into the mouth of you
and lies with a good taste on your tongue.&nbsp; And you goes
quick on through it till you comes to where the lights do blink,
and &rsquo;tis a large town and there be folk moving this way and
that and the music playing, and great fowls and horses
what&rsquo;s got clocks to the inside of they, a-stirring them up
for to run, and girls and men a-riding on them&mdash;And the
booths with red sugar and white, all lit and animals that&rsquo;s
wild a-roaring and a-biting in the tents&mdash;And girls
what&rsquo;s dancing, standing there in satin gowns all over gold
and silver&mdash;And you walks to and fro in it all and
&rsquo;tis good to be there and free&mdash;And &rsquo;tis better
to be in such places and to come and to go where you have a mind
than to be cooped in here, with th&rsquo; old woman and
all&mdash;&rsquo;Tis a fine life as you lives on the
roads&mdash;and &rsquo;tis a better one nor this, I can tell you,
Mother.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Who has gradually
been falling into sleep</i>.]&nbsp; I count &rsquo;tis so.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis prime in the freshening of the day.&nbsp; I count
I&rsquo;ll go along of you, come morning.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it, Mother,
that&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; Us&rsquo;ll take a bit of sleep afore we
sets off, won&rsquo;t us?&nbsp; And when morning comes,
us&rsquo;ll open the door and go out.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it, when
&rsquo;tis day.</p>
<p>[<i>Her head falls to one side of the chair and she is
presently asleep</i>.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">May</span> <i>watches her for some
moments</i>.&nbsp; <i>Then she gets up softly and wraps her shawl
round her</i>.&nbsp; <i>The window shews signs of a gray light
outside</i>, <span class="smcap">May</span> <i>goes quietly
towards the outer door</i>.&nbsp; <i>As she reaches it</i>, <span
class="smcap">Dorry</span> <i>comes into the room from the
staircase</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Going up to</i>
<span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.]&nbsp; Granny, &rsquo;tis the
New Year!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m come down to see to the fire and to get
breakfast for Dad and Gran&rsquo;ma.&nbsp; Why, Granny,
you&rsquo;re sleeping still.&nbsp; And where&rsquo;s that poor
tramp gone off to?&nbsp; [<i>She looks round the room and then
sees</i> <span class="smcap">May</span> <i>by the door</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; O, there you
are.&nbsp; Are you going out on the road afore &rsquo;tis got
light?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; [<i>In a hoarse
whisper</i>.]&nbsp; And that I be.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis very nigh to
daybreak, so &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Stop a moment.&nbsp;
[<i>Calling up the stairs</i>.]&nbsp; Daddy, the tramp woman,
she&rsquo;s moving off already.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; [<i>From
upstairs</i>.]&nbsp; Then give her a bit of bread to take along
of she.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care that anyone should go
an-hungered this day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Turning to</i>
<span class="smcap">May</span>.]&nbsp; There&mdash;you bide a
minute whilst I cuts the loaf.&nbsp; My Dad&rsquo;s going to get
married this day, and he don&rsquo;t care that anyone should go
hungry.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">May</span> <i>comes slowly back into the
room and stands watching</i> <span class="smcap">Dorry</span>,
<i>who fetches a loaf from the pantry and cuts it at the
table</i>.&nbsp; <i>Then she pulls aside the curtain and a dim
light comes in</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; The snow&rsquo;s very
nigh gone, and &rsquo;tis like as not as the sun may come out
presently.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a piece of bread to take along of
you.&nbsp; There, it&rsquo;s a good big piece, take and eat
it.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">May</span> <i>hesitates an instant</i>,
<i>then she stretches out her hand and takes the bread and puts
it beneath her shawl</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; And so there&rsquo;s
going to be a wedding here to-day?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis my Dad as
is to be married.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis poor work, is
twice marrying.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; My Dad&rsquo;s ever so
pleased, I han&rsquo;t seen him so pleased as I can
remember.&nbsp; I han&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Then maybe the second
choosing be the best.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Yes,
&rsquo;tis&mdash;Gran&rsquo;ma says as &rsquo;tis&mdash;and Dad,
he be ever so fond of Miss Sims&mdash;and I be, too.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Then you&rsquo;ve no
call to wish as her who&rsquo;s gone should come back to you,
like?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that
you&rsquo;re saying?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t never
want as your mammy what you&rsquo;ve lost should be amongst you
as afore?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; I never knowed my
mammy.&nbsp; Gran&rsquo;ma says she had got summat bad in her
blood.&nbsp; And Granny&rsquo;s got the same.&nbsp; But Miss
Sims, she&rsquo;s ever so nice to Dad and me, and I&rsquo;m real
pleased as she&rsquo;s coming to stop along of us always after
that they&rsquo;re married, like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; And th&rsquo; old woman
what&rsquo;s your gran&rsquo;ma, Dorry?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; However did you know
as I was called &ldquo;Dorry&rdquo;?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; I heard them call you so
last night.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; And whatever do you
want to know about Gran&rsquo;ma?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; What have her got to say
&rsquo;bout the&mdash;the&mdash;wench what&rsquo;s going to marry
your dad?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; O, Gran&rsquo;ma, she
thinks ever such a lot of Miss Sims, and she says as how poor
Dad, what&rsquo;s been served so bad, will find out soon what
&rsquo;tis to have a real decent wife, what&rsquo;ll help with
the work and all, and what won&rsquo;t lower him by her ways, nor
nothing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; Look you
here&mdash;&rsquo;tis growing day.&nbsp; I must be getting off
and on to the road.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Moving to the
door</i>.]&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll unbolt the door, then.&nbsp; O,
&rsquo;tis fine and daylight now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Turning back at the
doorway and looking at the room</i>.]&nbsp; I suppose you
wouldn&rsquo;t like to touch me, for good luck, Dorry?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; No, I
shouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Gran&rsquo;ma, she don&rsquo;t let me go
nigh road people as a rule.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a-feared as I
should take summat from them, I suppose.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Hoarsely</i>, <i>her
hand on the door</i>.]&nbsp; Then just say as you wishes me well,
Dorry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll wish you a
good New Year, then, and Gran&rsquo;ma said as I was to watch as
you cleared off the place.&nbsp; [<span class="smcap">May</span>
<i>goes out softly and quickly</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Dorry</span> <i>watches her until she is out of
sight</i>, <i>and then she shuts the door</i>.</p>
<h3>ACT III.&mdash;Scene 1.</h3>
<p><i>The same room</i>.&nbsp; <i>It is nearly mid-day</i>,
<i>and the room is full of sunshine</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Jane Browning</span>, <i>in her best dress</i>,
<i>is fastening</i> <span class="smcap">Dorry&rsquo;s</span>
<i>frock</i>, <i>close to the window</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Dad&rsquo;s been a
rare long time a-cleaning of his self up, Gran.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Will you bide
still!&nbsp; However&rsquo;s this frock to get fastened and you
moving this way and that like some live eel&mdash;and just see
what a mark you&rsquo;ve made on the elbow last night, putting
your arm down somewhere where you didn&rsquo;t ought to&mdash;I
might just as well have never washed the thing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Granny&rsquo;s sound
asleep still&mdash;she&rsquo;ll have to be waked time we goes
along to the church.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; That her shan&rsquo;t
be.&nbsp; Her shall just bide and sleep the drink out of her, her
shall.&nbsp; Do you think as I didn&rsquo;t find out who
&rsquo;twas what had got at the bottle as Dad left on the dresser
last night.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Poor Gran, she do take
a drop now and then.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Shame on th&rsquo; old
gipsy.&nbsp; Her shall be left to bide till she have slept off
some of the nonsense which is in her.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Granny do say a lot of
funny things sometimes, don&rsquo;t she, now?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; You get and put on your
hat and button your gloves, and let the old gipsy be.&nbsp; We
can send her off home when &rsquo;tis afternoon, and us back from
church.&nbsp; Now, where did I lay that bonnet?&nbsp; Here
&rsquo;tis.</p>
<p>[<i>She begins to tie the strings before a small mirror in the
wall</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Steve</span> <i>comes
downstairs in his shirt sleeves</i>, <i>carrying his
coat</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Why, Dad, you do look
rare pleased at summat.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; And when&rsquo;s a man
to look pleased if &rsquo;tis not on his wedding morn, Dorry?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; The tramp what was
here did say as how &rsquo;twas poor work twice marrying, but you
don&rsquo;t find it be so, Dad, do you now?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; And that I
don&rsquo;t, my little wench.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis as nigh heaven as
I be like to touch&mdash;and that&rsquo;s how &rsquo;tis with
me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking</i> <span
class="smcap">Steve&rsquo;s</span> <i>coat from him</i>.]&nbsp;
Ah, &rsquo;tis a different set out altogether this time.&nbsp;
That &rsquo;tis.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a-marrying into your own rank,
like, and no mixing up with they trolloping gipsies.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Was my own mammy a
trolloping gipsy, Gran?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Beginning to
brush</i> <span class="smcap">Steve&rsquo;s</span>
<i>coat</i>.]&nbsp; Ah, much in the same pattern as th&rsquo; old
woman what&rsquo;s drunk asleep against the fireside.&nbsp; Here,
button up them gloves, &rsquo;tis time we was off.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; I do like Miss
Sims.&nbsp; She do have nice things on her.&nbsp; When I grows up
I&rsquo;d like to look as she do, so I would.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; [<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Jane</span>.]&nbsp; There, Mother, that&rsquo;ll
do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d best put him on now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Holding out the
coat for him</i>.]&nbsp; Well, and you be got yourself up rare
smart, Steve.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis rare smart
as I be feeling, Mother.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m all a kind of a dazzle
within of me, same as &rsquo;tis with the sun upon the snow out
yonder.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Why, look you,
there&rsquo;s George a-coming up the path already.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s wearing of
the flower what Rosie gived him last night.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Opening the
door</i>.]&nbsp; Good morning, George.&nbsp; A first class New
Year to you.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re welcome, if ever a man was.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; You bide where you do
stand, George, till your feet is dry.&nbsp; My floor was fresh
wiped over this morning.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Standing on the
door mat</i>.]&nbsp; All right, Mrs. Browning.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
you fluster.&nbsp; Good morning, Dorry.&nbsp; How be you to-day,
Steve?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&nbsp; Dorry, come you
upstairs along with me and get your coat put on, so as your frock
bain&rsquo;t crushed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; O, I wish I could go
so that my nice frock was seen and no coat.</p>
<p>[<i>They go upstairs</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">George</span> <i>rubs his feet on the mat and comes
into the room</i>, <i>walking up and down once or twice
restlessly and in evident distress of mind</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Who has lit a pipe
and is smoking</i>.]&nbsp; Why, George, be you out of sorts this
morning?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t look up to much, and that&rsquo;s
the truth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Stopping
before</i> <span class="smcap">Steve</span>.]&nbsp; Hark you,
Steve.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis on my mind to ask summat of you.&nbsp;
Did you have much speech with the poor thing what you took in
from the snow last night?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; No, George, and that I
didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Her was mostly in a kind of drunken sleep all
the time, and naught to be got out from she.&nbsp; Mother, her
tried.&nbsp; But &rsquo;twas like trying to get water from the
pump yonder, when &rsquo;tis froze.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Your mother&rsquo;s a
poor one at melting ice, Steve, and &rsquo;tis what we all
knows.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Ah,
&rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t much as we could do for the likes of
she&mdash;what was a regular roadster.&nbsp; Bad herbs, all of
them.&nbsp; And if it hadn&rsquo;t been so as &rsquo;twas my
wedding eve, this one shouldn&rsquo;t have set foot inside of the
house.&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis a season when a man&rsquo;s took a
bit soft and foolish, like, the night afore his marriage.&nbsp;
Bain&rsquo;t that so, George?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; And when was it,
Steve, as she went off from here?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; That I couldn&rsquo;t
rightly say, George, but I counts &rsquo;twas just upon
daybreak.&nbsp; And &rsquo;twas Dorry what seed her off the place
and gived her a piece of bread to take along of her.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; And do you think as
she got talking a lot to Dorry, Steve?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m blest if I
do know, George.&nbsp; I never gived another thought to
she.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s up?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; They was getting the
body of her from out of Simon&rsquo;s Pool as I did come
by.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; From Simon&rsquo;s
Pool, George?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; I count her must have
went across the plank afore &rsquo;twas fairly daylight.&nbsp;
And, being slippery, like, from the snow, and
her&mdash;her&mdash;as you did say.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; In liquor.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; I reckon as her
missed her footing, like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Well, upon my word,
George, who&rsquo;d have thought on such a thing!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; I count as her had
been in the water and below the ice a smartish while afore they
catched sight of she.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Well, &rsquo;tis a
cold finish to a hot life.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; They took and laid
her on the grass, Steve, as I comed by.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; If it had been me,
I&rsquo;d have turned the head of me t&rsquo;other side.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; There was summat in
the fashion her was laid, Steve, as drawed I near for to get a
sight of the face of she.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Well, I
shouldn&rsquo;t have much cared for that, George.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Steve&mdash;did you
get a look into the eyes of yon poor thing last night?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; No, nor wanted for to,
neither.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; There was naught to
make you think of&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Of what, George?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; There&mdash;Steve, I
can&rsquo;t get it out, I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Then let it bide
in.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas the way
her was laid, and the long arms of she, and the hands which was
clapped one on t&rsquo;other, as it might be in church.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking through
the window</i>.]&nbsp; You shut up, George.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s
Annie with Rose a-coming up to the door.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
get saying another word about yon poor wretch nor the end of
her.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t have my Annie upset for all the world
to-day.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a thing as must not be spoke of afore
they, nor Dorry neither, do you hear?</p>
<p>[<i>He moves towards the door and puts his hand to the
latch</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; Hold back, Steve, a
minute.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s summat more as I&rsquo;ve got to
say.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; You take and shut your
mouth up, old George, afore I opens the door to the girls.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis bound for
to come from me afore you goes along to church, Steve.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; I warrant &rsquo;twill
keep till us do come home again, George.</p>
<p>[<i>He throws the door wide open with a joyous
movement</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Annie</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Rose</span> <i>in white dresses stand
outside</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Well, Annie, this is a
rare surprise, and that&rsquo;s the truth.&nbsp; [<span
class="smcap">Annie</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Rose</span> <i>come into the room</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; Father, he&rsquo;s
outside, and Jim and Bill and Katie, and all the rest.&nbsp; We
said as &rsquo;twould be pleasanter if we was all to go up
together along to the church.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; So &rsquo;twould
be&mdash;so &rsquo;twould be&mdash;&rsquo;Twas a grand thought of
yourn, Rosie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; Steve&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Taking her
hand</i>.]&nbsp; Annie, I&rsquo;m fair beside myself this
day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span>.&nbsp; O, Steve, there was
never a day in my life like this one.&nbsp; [<span
class="smcap">Dorry</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Jane</span> <i>come down</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; O, Miss Sims, you do
look nice!&nbsp; Gran&rsquo;ma, don&rsquo;t Miss Sims look
nice?&nbsp; And Rosie, too.&nbsp; O, they have nice gowns and
hats on, haven&rsquo;t they, Dad?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see no
gowns nor hats, and that&rsquo;s the truth.&nbsp; But I sees
summat what&rsquo;s like&mdash;what&rsquo;s like a meadow of
grass in springtime afore the sun&rsquo;s got on to it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Why, Dad, &rsquo;tis
white, not green, as Miss Sims is wearing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis in the eyes
of her as I finds my meadow.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; O, let me see, Dad,
let me look, too!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis with the

<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; Look at what
he&rsquo;s wearing in his buttonhole, Rosie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis kept

<p><span class="smcap">Steve</span>.&nbsp; Come on, George.&nbsp;
Come, Dorry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorry</span>.&nbsp; O, isn&rsquo;t it a
pity as Granny will get at the drink, Mr. Davis?&nbsp; And

Dad smile like this afore.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">George</span>.&nbsp;
[<i>Heavily</i>.]&nbsp; Come on, Dorry&mdash;you take hold of

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Calling from

<p>[<i>They all go out</i>.</p>
<h3>ACT III.&mdash;Scene 2.</h3>
<p><i>Nearly an hour later</i>.&nbsp; <i>The cottage room is full
of sunlight</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti Reed</span> <i>is awake and gazing
vacantly about her from the same chair by the fire</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Someone knocks repeatedly at the door from outside</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; And &rsquo;tis no bit
of rest as I gets for my bones, but they must come and hustle I
and call I from the dreams which was soft.&nbsp; [<i>The knocking
is heard again</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; And I up and says to
they, &ldquo;Ah, and you would hustle a poor old woman
what&rsquo;s never harmed so much as a hair out of the ugly heads
of you.&nbsp; You would hunt and drive of her till she be very
nigh done to death.&nbsp; But there shall come a day when you
shall be laid down and a-taking of your bit of rest, and the
thing what you knows of shall get up upon you and smite you till
you do go screeching from the house, and fleeing to the uttermost
part of the land&mdash;whilst me and mine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>[<i>The door opens and</i> <span class="smcap">Harry
Moss</span> <i>enters</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; Beg pardon, old
Missis, but I couldn&rsquo;t make no one hear me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; Seeing as them be
sick of the abomination which was inside of they.&nbsp;
[<i>Perceiving</i> <span class="smcap">Harry</span>.]&nbsp; Well,
and what be you as is comed into this room?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis Moss as I
be called, old Missis.&nbsp; And as I was a-going by this place,
I thought as I&rsquo;d look in a moment, just for to ask how
&rsquo;twas with May.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; They be all gone out
from the house.&nbsp; All of them.&nbsp; They be in clothes what
do lie in boxes most of the time with lumps of white among
they.&nbsp; Them be set out in the best as they has, and in grand
things of many colours.&nbsp; There &rsquo;tis.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; And be you th&rsquo;
old lady what&rsquo;s Steve&rsquo;s mother?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; I be not, sir.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis mother to May as I be.&nbsp; May, what&rsquo;s comed
back, and what&rsquo;ll set t&rsquo;other old vixen in her place
soon as they get home.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; Then May, she be gone
out, too, have her?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking round
vaguely</i>.]&nbsp; Ah, I counts as her be gone to church along
of t&rsquo;other.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; To church, Missis?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
marrying being done down here to-day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; Marrying, be
there?&nbsp; Well, but I was &rsquo;most feared as how it might
have been t&rsquo;other thing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; Ah, that there
be&mdash;marrying.&nbsp; But there bain&rsquo;t no more victuals
got into the house as I knows of.&nbsp; Th&rsquo; old
woman&rsquo;s seen to that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; And be May gone out,
too, along of them to see the marrying?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; Ah, I counts as her
be.&nbsp; But her&rsquo;s a-coming back in a little while, and
you may sit down and bide till she does.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d sooner be
about and on my way, Missis, if &rsquo;tis all the same to
you.&nbsp; But I thanks you kindly.&nbsp; And you get and tell
May when she do come home, that &rsquo;tis particular glad I be
for to know as her bain&rsquo;t took worse, nor nothing.&nbsp;
And should I happen in these parts again, &rsquo;tis very likely
as I&rsquo;ll take a look in on she some day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; Ah, her&rsquo;ll have
got t&rsquo;other old baggage set in the right place by then.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Looking round
him</i>.]&nbsp; Well, I be rare pleased to think of May so
comfortable, like, for her was got down terrible low.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp;
T&rsquo;other&rsquo;ll be broughted lower.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; Look you here, old
Missis, &rsquo;tis a stomach full of naught as I carries.&nbsp;
If so be as you has a crust to spare&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Pointing to a
door</i>.]&nbsp; There be a plate of meat inside of that
cupboard.&nbsp; You take and fill your belly with it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; Thank you kindly,
Missis, but I counts I han&rsquo;t the time for heavy feeding
this morning.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould serve
she right, th&rsquo; old sinner, for the place to be licked up
clean, against the time when her was come&rsquo;d back, so
&rsquo;twould.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; Well, Missis, you can
tell May &rsquo;tis a brave New Year as I do wish she.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Listening to
bells which are heard suddenly ringing</i>.]&nbsp; There, there
they be!&nbsp; Harken to them!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis with bells as
they be coming out.&nbsp; Bells what&rsquo;s ringing.&nbsp; I
count &rsquo;tis fine as May do look now in her marriage
gown.&nbsp; Harken, &rsquo;tis the bells a-shaking of the window
pane.&nbsp; I be an old woman, but the hearing of me bain&rsquo;t
spoiled.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; I warrant it
bain&rsquo;t, Missis.&nbsp; Why, they&rsquo;re ringing wonderful
smart.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis enough, upon my word, for to fetch down
every stone of the old place.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; Get you out upon the
garden path and tell I if you sees them a-coming.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it, old
Missis, and so I will.</p>
<p>[<i>He goes outside the house</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vashti</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Sitting upright
and looking with fixed vacancy before her</i>.]&nbsp; And when
they was all laid low and the heads of them bowed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You would, would you,&rdquo; I says, for they was lifting
the ends of their ugly mouths at I.&nbsp; And I passed among they
and them did quail and crouch, being with fear.&nbsp; And me and
mine did reach the place what was on the top.&nbsp; &ldquo;See
now yourselves,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;if so be that you do not go
in blindness and in dark.&rdquo;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas May what stood
there aside of I.&nbsp; And &ldquo;Look you,&rdquo; I says,
&ldquo;over the bended necks of you my child shall pass.&nbsp;
For you be done to death by the lies which growed within you and
waxed till the bodies of you was fed with them and the poison did
gush out from your lips.&rdquo;&nbsp; But my little child stood
in the light, and the hands of her was about the stars.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.&nbsp; [<i>Coming
in</i>.]&nbsp; Look, they be all a-coming over the meadow, old
Missis.&nbsp; But May han&rsquo;t comed with they&mdash;May
han&rsquo;t come too.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
